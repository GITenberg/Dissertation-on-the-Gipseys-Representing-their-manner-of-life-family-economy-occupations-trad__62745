already appeared in an English dress, having been, some years
since, translated by the late M. Raper, Esq. F.R.S. and A.S. for
the purpose, as he states in his preface, of affording
&ldquo;such of his countrymen as were unacquainted with the
German language an opportunity of learning from what part of the
world it is probable the Gipseys came among us.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
original work, and Mr. Raper&rsquo;s translation, are burthened
with many notes&mdash;Greek, Latin, French, German,
English&mdash;shewing the sources whence the information was
derived, most of which, for obvious reasons, are omitted in the
present edition; such only being retained as were thought
indispensable, or particularly interesting.</p>

<h2><a name="page2_1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Gipseys are a singular
phenomenon in Europe; whether we contemplate their habitations,
attend at their meals, or merely look in their faces, they always
appear particular, and we are each moment struck with something
new and extraordinary.</p>
<p>What appears most worthy of remark is, that neither time,
climate, nor example, has, in general, hitherto, made any
alteration.&nbsp; For the space of between three and four hundred
years, they have gone wandering about, like pilgrims and
strangers: they are found in eastern and western countries, as
well among the rude as civilised, the indolent as active, people:
yet they remain ever, and in all places, what their fathers
were&mdash;Gipseys.&nbsp; Africa makes them no blacker, nor
Europe whiter: they neither learn to be lazy in Spain, nor
diligent in Germany: in Turkey, Mahomet, and among Christians,
Christ, remain equally without adoration.&nbsp; Around, on every
side, they see fixed dwellings, with settled inhabitants; they,
nevertheless, proceed in their own way, and continue, for the
most part, unsocial wandering robbers.</p>
<p>When we search for similar cases, among all the different
people who have quitted their mother <a name="page2_ii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ii</span>country, and inhabited a foreign one,
we do not meet with a single instance that exactly agrees with
that of the Gipseys.&nbsp; History certainly does record accounts
of people that have migrated, and remained the same in a strange
country; but then this constancy has been on account of religion,
either permitted by the regents, or maintained by their
victorious arms: though this last circumstance has existed much
less frequently than might be imagined.&nbsp; Many instances have
occurred in which, the people subdued being more enlightened than
their conquerors, the latter have adopted the manners of the
former.&nbsp; The Romans became Greeks on the conquest of Greece;
and the Franks assumed the manners of the Gauls when in
possession of their country: the Mantcheous vanquished the
Chinese; but Chinese customs prevailed over those of the
Mantcheous.&nbsp; How, then, does it happen that the Gipseys, who
never either established their manners and customs by force, or
obtained any toleration from governments under which they lived,
remain unchanged, and resemble each other exactly, in every
place?&nbsp; There are two causes, to which this coincidence is
principally owing: one is the place whence they originate, with
their consequent mode of thinking; the other arises from the
circumstances which have hitherto attended their situation.</p>
<p>The Gipseys are unquestionably of eastern origin, <a
name="page2_iii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iii</span>and have
eastern notions.&nbsp; There is a principle inherent in
uncivilised people, particularly those of Oriental countries,
which occasions them to be strongly attached to their own habits:
hence every custom, every conception, which has once been current
among them, be it ever so pernicious or ridiculous, is invariably
preserved; or any affection which has once predominated in their
minds, retains its dominion even for ages.&nbsp; Innovations do
not easily succeed with people living in a state bordering on
that of nature; the least deviation from custom is observed, and
often resented with impetuosity.&nbsp; For any new thing to take
root it must either be introduced by cunning and force, or be
attended with the most favourable circumstances.&nbsp; This
latter was the case with Christianity.&nbsp; Providence had
called Greeks and Romans into the east, and, by innumerable
vicissitudes, had rendered that country ripe for further
instruction: then came the great Sower&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Christ</span> scattered the seed, and it
prospered.&nbsp; Mahomet, on the contrary, before he became
strong enough to enforce conviction with the sword, brought about
his purpose by art: knowing that the weak side of his countrymen
was their veneration for every thing handed down from their
forefathers, he gave his new religion the colouring of
antiquity.</p>
<p>Mahomet says, &ldquo;We have swerved from the religion of our
founder Abraham, and have introduced <a name="page2_iv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. iv</span>novelties among us.&nbsp; Abraham
worshipped only one God; we have many Gods.&nbsp; I am sent to
retrench these novelties, and to bring you back to the religion
of your forefathers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the first ground on
which he went.&nbsp; When the Ishmaelite would not acquiesce in
the charge of having fallen off from Abraham&rsquo;s religion,
Mahomet proceeded: &ldquo;Ye are illiterate people; ye have no
books: the inhabitants of the neighbouring countries have books,
which contain the religion of Abraham.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Arabians
applied to the Jews and Christians, for information on this head;
and as the event turned in favour of the pretended prophet, they
yielded without contradiction.&nbsp; Mahomet proceeded in
teaching, and again appealed to the people with books: the
Arabians, too, continued asking questions, being more tractable
whenever his assertions were confirmed; but when the contrary
happened, a dispute arose, in which the prophet could only get
the better by defending the antiquity of his madness at the
expence of truth, accusing both the Jews and Christians with
having falsified their books.</p>
<p>The same means that helped Mahomet with the Arabians, have
been, in latter times, very serviceable to the Jesuits, in
China.&nbsp; How would these cunning fathers have obtained
admission for their religion among the Chinese, had they <a
name="page2_v"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>not referred
to Confucius, in aid of their doctrines?&nbsp; These are only
instances of changes in religion; but the case is precisely the
same in other things.&nbsp; In the eastern nations, no
improvement is adopted, be it of what kind it may, merely because
it is an improvement.&nbsp; The Chinese are acquainted with the
use of glass; yet their mirrors are always made of metal, and
their windows of oyster-shells.&nbsp; Mechanical watches have
been for ages used at the court of Pekin; but the bulk of the
nation depend upon fire and water. <a name="citationv"></a><a
href="#footnotev" class="citation">[v]</a></p>
<p>It is evident from the above, that the Gipseys, by reason of
their eastern origin, and consequent way of thinking, are not
easily made to change their principles and habits.&nbsp; When we
further consider the circumstances under which these people have
hitherto existed, we want nothing more to make us comprehend why
they have remained, to the present time, what they were at their
first arrival in Europe.</p>
<p>Figure to yourself a person, in whom custom, and deep-rooted
affections, are the only, and at the same time strong, impulses
to action; in whose soul no new unwonted thoughts arise, in
consequence of his own reflections, nor find easy <a
name="page2_vi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>admittance
when proposed by others:&mdash;leave this man entirely to
himself; do not permit any of those means to be used which are
requisite to give a new turn to his ideas, and deep-rooted
prejudices:&mdash;he must necessarily remain the same; and his
latest posterity will continue like him: this is exactly the case
with the Gipseys.&nbsp; Unused to reflect, fettered by habits,
they arrived in our quarter of the globe.&nbsp; No state has,
hitherto, done any thing for the express purpose of instructing
or reforming them; except the Empress Theresa, by her
regulations, which were never put in execution.&nbsp; On their
first arrival, they procured passports, and free quarters, by
their holy lies.&nbsp; They dispersed, begged, deceived the
common people, by fortune telling: they stole: and for a long
time no attention was paid to them.&nbsp; At last the evil grew
too enormous; the complaints against them became so loud, that
government was constrained to take official notice of them.&nbsp;
Exemplary punishments were judged necessary: hanging and
beheading were not sufficiently efficacious; and it was then
thought expedient to banish them;&mdash;a proceeding more likely
to render them worse than better, and even in other respects
liable to many objections; still the custom has prevailed, down
to the latest times.&nbsp; The neighbour, to whom these
unpolished guests were sent, sooner or later, followed the same
method <a name="page2_vii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>of disengaging the evil, till, in the end, they were
persecuted by almost all kingdoms and governments.&nbsp; Many
states afterwards relaxing in their severity, the Gipseys were
suffered to creep in, a few at a time, and were permitted to
remain quiet: yet every one of them stood in fear, innocent or
guilty, lest he might be taken unawares, merely because he was
Gipsey, and delivered over to the executioner.&nbsp; They had
been accustomed, in their own country, to live remote from cities
and towns: now they became still more uniformly inhabitants of
the forests, and outcasts; as, in consequence of the search which
was made after them, or at least threatened to be made, they
judged themselves to be more secure in deserts and concealment,
than they would have been if frequenting places of established
abode, and having free intercourse with the civilised
inhabitants: whereby they were divested of the most, perhaps
only, probable means of inducing them to change their
manners.&nbsp; And yet, had they not sequestered themselves from
other people, or had they been more inclined to mix in society,
it is not likely, without some direct interference of government,
that they would have been rendered better.&nbsp; There were two
great obstacles to be surmounted:&mdash;first, by mere
intercourse, it would have been, generally speaking, difficult to
eradicate the prejudices and customs from their Oriental <a
name="page2_viii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>minds:
secondly, being Gipseys, people would not willingly have
established any correspondence with them.&nbsp; Let us reflect
how different they are from Europeans: the one is white, the
other black;&mdash;this clothes himself, the other goes half
naked;&mdash;this shudders at the thought of eating carrion, the
other regales on it as a dainty.&nbsp; Moreover these people are
famed, and were even from their first appearance in Europe, for
being plunderers, thieves, and incendiaries: the European, in
consequence, not merely dislikes, but hates them.&nbsp; For the
reasons above stated, the Gipseys have been, at different
periods, driven from all the countries of Europe; and only a few
simple people occasionally made a nearer acquaintance, in order
to consult them on matters of superstition.</p>
<p>Such is the state of what has been done, and attempted, for
the improvement of the Gipseys; whereas, so soon as it was
discovered that they were strangers, who thought of nothing less
than of returning into their own country, if any plan had been
acted upon for their reformation, and only half the wise
regulations left behind by the Empress Theresa in her states for
the management of these people been adopted, and duly enforced,
they would long ago have been divested of the rude nature of
their ancestors, and have ceased to be the uncultivated branches
of a wild stock.&nbsp; On the contrary, having always been either
left to themselves <a name="page2_ix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ix</span>or persecuted, it could not be
otherwise, but that they must remain for ever, and in all places,
the same.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is reserved for our age, in which so much has been
attempted for the benefit of mankind, to humanise a people who,
for centuries, have wandered in error and neglect: and it may be
hoped, that while we are endeavouring to ameliorate the condition
of our African brethren, the civilisation of the Gipseys, who
form so large a portion of humanity, will not be
overlooked.&nbsp; It cannot be denied, that, considering the
multitude of them, their reform must be an object of very serious
consideration to many states.&nbsp; Suppose, according to a rough
estimate, that the Gipseys in Hungary and Transylvania, including
the Banat, amount to upwards of one hundred thousand; what a
difference would it not make, in those countries, if one hundred
thousand inhabitants, mostly loungers, beggars, cheats, and
thieves, who now reap where they have not sown, consuming the
fruits of others&rsquo; labour, were to become industrious useful
subjects!&nbsp; Their reformation would be a difficult task, as
the attempts made by the Empress Theresa evinced:&mdash;a boy
(for you must begin with children, and not meddle with the old
stock, on whom no efforts will have effect) would frequently seem
in the most promising train to civilisation; on a sudden his wild
nature would <a name="page2_x"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>appear, a relapse follow, and he became a perfect Gipsey
again.&nbsp; But the measure is not, therefore, impossible: Was
not the case precisely the same with the Saxons, whom Charles the
Great converted to Christianity?&nbsp; Let the state resolving to
appropriate the Gipsey tribe only persevere in its endeavours;
some effect will be gained on the second generation, and with the
third or fourth, the end will certainly be accomplished.</p>
<p>By an attentive observation, we may perceive that the Gipseys
are endued with very good capacities, which promise to make a
profitable return, for much trouble bestowed upon them.&nbsp; In
the first Section one attempt, made on this speculation, is
produced, and it is hoped it will be found sufficiently complete,
to exhibit the leading features of their character.</p>
<p>The origin of the Gipseys has remained a perfect
philosopher&rsquo;s stone till a late period.&nbsp; For more than
two hundred years, people have been anxious to discover who these
guests were, that, under the name of Gipseys, came, unknown and
uninvited, into Europe, in the fifteenth century, and have chosen
to remain here ever since.&nbsp; No enquirer ever broached an
opinion that met with his successor&rsquo;s approbation; a fourth
scarcely heard what a third had said, before he passed sentence
and advanced something new.&nbsp; We have no reason to wonder at
the miscarriage of these enquiries, which <a
name="page2_xi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>were
neither more nor less than a collection of conjectures founded on
imaginary proofs and partial speculation.&mdash;An author set to
work, to discover a country whence the Gipseys came, or a people
to whom they could belong; he found out a place which had been
named, for instance, Zeugitana, or a people who bore some faint
resemblance to the Gipseys.&nbsp; As one coal lights another, so
these two similarities became perfectly applicable to the people
whose origin he was seeking; he stopped here, and published his
discovery.</p>
<p>Several investigators laid their foundation on hearsay, and
unauthenticated evidence; they then endeavoured to assist this
testimony by modelling the extraneous circumstances which could
not be passed over, in order to make them coincide; if,
notwithstanding all this, difficulties still occurred, they
borrowed Alexander&rsquo;s sword, and cut the knot which no
milder means could undo.</p>
<p>That this has been the mode of proceeding hitherto, will be
frequently proved in the course of the work.&nbsp; Even had the
imagination not magnified any thing, nor modelled circumstances
agreeably to its own fancy, yet the following, which is taken for
granted, &ldquo;<i>that two people resembling each other in one
or two particulars</i>, <i>must be descended from the same
stock</i>,&rdquo; is an over-hasty conclusion.&nbsp; In the first
place, reject that the most different nations <a
name="page2_xii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>may agree
in some points; further, make the allowance for various parts of
the world producing inhabitants of similar shape and
colour;&mdash;What, then, remains to prove that the Gipseys are
descended from any one of the people from whom they have been
traced?</p>
<p>There are no records, or historical sources, leading to a
direct discovery of the origin of the Gipseys; those which have
been thought so, are not genuine.&nbsp; Nothing, therefore,
remains, but to seek the truth, through circuitous tracks; by
this means, it may certainly be found.&nbsp; A man must not go to
tombstones, recently erected, in German church-yards, nor adduce
a single custom, or the name of a country bearing a resemblance
to that of Gipsey, as grounds of proof; and, on the other hand,
overlook a hundred difficulties, or even positive
contradictions.&nbsp; But if <i>the language of the Gipseys</i>,
<i>their name</i>, <i>the conformation of their bodies and
minds</i>, <i>their customs and religious principles</i>, <i>mark
a country where it is possible for them to have been
indigenous</i>; <i>when History and Chronology corroborate the
supposition</i>, <i>and there is not any other country in the
world to which the Gipseys</i>, <i>all these particulars taken
together</i>, <i>could belong</i>; then the country, where these
circumstances meet, must, in all probability, be their true
mother country.</p>
<p>Whether their Hindostan origin has so much in <a
name="page2_xiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>its
favour, is more than we dare venture to affirm; as it is very
possible for the judgment to be so deceived, that we may believe
what does not, in fact, exist.&nbsp; However, on perusing the
subsequent pages, our readers will judge if, like our
predecessors, we have erred, or have discovered the truth.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">DESCRIPTION OF THE GIPSEYS, THEIR MANNER
OF LIFE, THEIR CUSTOMS AND PROPERTIES.</span></h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Various Appellations of these
People</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not uncommon for the same
people to be called by different names, in different nations;
such is the case with the Gipseys.&nbsp; The French received
their first accounts of them from Bohemia; which occasioned their
giving them the name of Bohemians (<i>Boh&eacute;miens</i>); the
Dutch, supposing they came from Egypt, called them Heathens
(<i>Heydens</i>).&nbsp; In Denmark, Sweden, and some parts of
Germany, Tartars were thought of: the Moors and Arabians,
perceiving the propensity the Gipseys have to thieving, adopted
the name <a name="page3_2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span><i>Charami</i> (robbers) for them.&nbsp; In Hungary, they
were formerly called Pharaohites (<i>Pharaoh nepek</i>,
Pharaoh&rsquo;s people); and the vulgar, in Transylvania,
continue that name for them.&nbsp; The English do not differ much
from these latter (calling them Egyptians&mdash;Gipseys); any
more than the Portuguese and Spaniards (<i>Gitanos</i>).&nbsp;
The Clementines, in Smyrnia, use the appellation <i>Madjub</i>;
and the inhabitants of the lesser Bucharia, that of
<i>Diajii</i>.&nbsp; The name of Zigeuner has obtained the most
general adoption: the Gipseys are so called not only in all
Germany, Italy, and Hungary (<i>Tzigany</i>), but frequently in
Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia (<i>Cyganis</i>).&nbsp;
Moreover the Turks, and other eastern nations, have no other than
this name for them (<i>Tschingen&eacute;s</i>); and perhaps the
before-cited Diajii of the Bucharians may be the very same.&nbsp;
It has been said, they call themselves Moors; but that is false;
Moor is only an adjunct, not the name of any people: it is really
a pity, since this name would have been so fair a pretence to
make Amorites of them, as some writers have done!&nbsp; It is not
by any means proved, that the modern Greeks called them
<i>Athingans</i>; this opinion is supported more by the arbitrary
assertions of some learned men, than by real facts: which is also
the case with the rest of the catalogue of names that have been
dispersed, in various treatises on the origin of the Gipseys; as
will be hereafter demonstrated.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>On the Dispersion of the Gipseys</i>,
<i>and their Numbers in Europe</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> numerous hordes of Gipseys,
widely dispersed over the face of the earth, are
incredible.&nbsp; They wander about in Asia; in the interior part
of Africa, they plunder the merchants of Agades; <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> and, like locusts, have overrun most of
the countries of Europe.&nbsp; America seems to be the only part
of the world where they are not known; no mention appearing to be
made of them by authors who have written on that quarter of the
globe.&nbsp; It would be superfluous to dilate on the history of
those in Asia and Africa, as we have no minute accounts of them;
we shall therefore confine ourselves to those in Europe.</p>
<p>There are but few countries, here, which are entirely free
from Gipseys; although, for centuries, every state has been
endeavouring to rid itself of them.&nbsp; Under King Henry VIII,
and in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, they suffered a general
persecution <a name="page3_4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>in England: there are, nevertheless, great numbers still
to be found there.&nbsp; About thirty years ago, they even
threatened to set the town of Northampton on fire, because the
magistrates had arrested some of their young people, whose
release they solicited in vain: several of the ringleaders were
hanged: they had in the mean time shewn plainly, that their race
was very far from being annihilated.&nbsp; It is not uncommon, in
the county of Bedford particularly, to see them lying in
byplaces, to the number of forty or fifty together: but they are
cautious how they travel about in companies, and are rarely seen
in towns or villages but by one at a time.</p>
<p>Spain, especially the southern provinces, contains so many of
these people, that they rove about in large troops, threatening
to plunder and murder travellers whom they happen to meet in
lonely places: at a distance from the cities, and where no place
of refuge is near, danger is always to be apprehended.&nbsp;
Swinburne rates their number very high; he asserts, that the loss
of the Gipseys would immediately be perceived by the apparent
diminution of population.&nbsp; Now as Spain contains eleven
millions of people, how considerable a draft must there be to
render it perceptible!&nbsp; Twiss also mentions a great many,
but sums up a determinate number, 40,000; which is certainly
considerable, but probably twice twenty, or even twice forty, <a
name="page3_5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>thousand too
few;&mdash;unless we charge Swinburne, and others, with having
greatly exaggerated;&mdash;even admitting, that he means to be
understood as speaking of the southern provinces only.</p>
<p>In France, before the revolution, there were but few, for the
obvious reason, that every Gipsey who could be apprehended, fell
a sacrifice to the police.&nbsp; Lorrain and Alsatia were indeed
exceptions; they being very numerous there, especially in the
forests of Lorrain.&nbsp; Here they seem to have met with milder
treatment; yet, according to the assurances of a traveller, many
of them were to be found in the gaols of Lorrain.&nbsp; They
increased the more in this district, in consequence of their
having been very assiduously looked after, and driven from the
dominions of a late Duke of Deuxponts, whither his successor
would not suffer them to return.</p>
<p>They were universally to be found in Italy, insomuch that even
Sicily and Sardinia were not free.&nbsp; But they were most
numerous in the dominions of the church; probably because
<i>there</i> was the worst police, with much superstition: by the
former they were left undisturbed, and the latter enticed them to
deceive the ignorant, as it afforded them an opportunity of
obtaining a plentiful contribution by their fortune-telling, and
enchanted amulets.&nbsp; There was a general law throughout
Italy, that no Gipsey should remain more than two nights <a
name="page3_6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>in any one
place: by this regulation, it is true, no place retained its
guest long; but no sooner was one gone, than another came in his
room: it was a continual circle, and quite as convenient to them
as a perfect toleration would have been.&nbsp; Italy rather
suffered than benefited by this law; as, by keeping these people
in constant motion, they would do more mischief there than in
places where they were permitted to remain stationary.</p>
<p>They are very scarce in many parts of Germany; as well as in
Switzerland and the Low-countries.&nbsp; A person may live many
years in Upper Saxony, or in the districts of Hanover and
Brunswic, without seeing a single Gipsey: when one happens to
stray into a village, or town, he occasions as much disturbance
as if the black gentleman with his cloven foot had appeared; he
frights children from their play, and draws the attention of the
older people; till the police officers get hold of him, and make
him again invisible.&nbsp; In other provinces, on the contrary,
particularly on the Rhine, a Gipsey is a very common sight.&nbsp;
Some years ago there were such numbers of them in the dutchy of
Wirtemburg, that they seen lying about every where: but as,
according to custom, they either lived by thieving, by
fortune-telling or other tricks, plundering the illiterate people
of their money, the government ordered detachments of <a
name="page3_7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>soldiers to
drive them from their holes and lurking-places throughout the
country; and then transported the congregated swarm, in the same
manner as they were treated by the Duke of Deuxponts, as before
related.</p>
<p>In Poland and Lithuania, as well as in Courland, there is an
amazing number of Gipseys.&nbsp; Their wayvode in Courland is
distinguished from the principals of hordes in other countries;
being not only very much respected by his own people, but, even
by the Courland nobility, is esteemed a man of high rank, and is
frequently to be met with at entertainments and card parties in
the first families, where he is always a welcome guest.&nbsp; His
dress is uncommonly rich, in comparison with others of his tribe;
generally silk in summer, and constantly velvet in winter.&nbsp;
The common Gipseys, on the contrary, are, in every particular,
exactly like their brethren in other countries: even with regard
to religion, they shew the same levity and
indifference;&mdash;they suffer their children to be several
times baptised; now they profess themselves to be Catholics, then
Lutherans, and presently after nothing at all.</p>
<p>That they are to be found in Denmark, and Sweden, is certain,
but how numerous they are in those countries we cannot affirm;
and therefore proceed to the south-east of Europe.</p>
<p>The countries in this part seem to be the general <a
name="page3_8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>rendezvous of
the Gipseys: their number amounts in Hungary, according to a
probable statement, to upwards of 50,000; and in the districts of
the Banat, Grisellini assures us, that when Count Clary occupied
the situation of president, they were reckoned at 5500: yet they
appear to be still more numerous in Transylvania.&nbsp; It is not
only Mr. Benko, a German writer, who says they swarm upon the
land like locusts, but we have also certain calculation, wherein
their numbers are estimated at between 35 and 36,000.</p>
<p>Cantemir says, the Gipseys are dispersed all over Moldavia,
where every baron has several families of them subject to him: in
Wallachia, and the Sclavonian countries, they are quite as
numerous.&nbsp; In Wallachia and Moldavia they are divided into
two classes&mdash;the princely, and bojarish: the former,
according to Sulzer, amounts to many thousands; but that is
trifling, in comparison with the latter, as there is not a single
bojar in Wallachia who has not at least three or four of them for
slaves; the rich have often some hundreds each, under their
command.</p>
<p>Bessarabia, all Tartary, Bulgaria, Greece, and Romania, swarm
with them; even in Constantinople they are innumerable.&nbsp; In
Romania, a large tract of Mount H&aelig;mus, which they inhabit
has acquired from them the name <i>Tschenghe Valkan</i> (Gipsey
Mountain).&nbsp; This district extends from <a
name="page3_9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the city
Aydos, quite to Philippopolis, and contains more Gipseys than any
other province in the Turkish empire.</p>
<p>From what has been advanced, the reader will be enabled to
form some conception, how considerable a class of people the
Gipseys are in Europe; independent of their numbers in Egypt, and
some parts of Asia.</p>
<p>If we could obtain an exact estimate of them in the different
countries, or if the unsettled life of these people did not
render it extremely difficult, perhaps impossible, to procure
such information, the immense number would probably greatly
exceed what we have any idea of.&nbsp; At a moderate calculation,
without being extravagant, they might be reckoned at between 7
and 800,000.&nbsp; What a serious matter of consideration when we
reflect, that the greatest part of these people are idlers,
cheats, and thieves!&nbsp; What a field does this open for the
contemplation of governments!&mdash;But more of this in another
place.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The Properties of their Bodies</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Had</span> the Gipseys made but a
temporary appearance, and we could only be acquainted with them
from the publications of former centuries, it would be difficult
to entertain any other idea than that they were a herd of
monsters and beelzebubs.&nbsp; We find in those books frequent
mention of a <i>savage people</i>, <i>black horrid men</i>.&nbsp;
But now that they have continued to our time, and we have an
opportunity of seeing, with our own eyes, how they are formed,
and what appearance they make, they are so fortunate as to have
authors who commend their beauty, and take great pains to set
forth their advantages; though many, indeed most of the moderns,
their colour and looks being the same, perfectly agree with the
writers of past centuries, in their accounts of them.&nbsp; Both
parties may be in the right, when we consider, that what appears
beautiful in the eyes of one person, is possibly ugly and
deformed in the eyes of another: this depends entirely upon habit
and familiarity.&nbsp; For this reason, the dark brown, or olive
coloured, skin of the Gipseys, with their white teeth appearing
between their red lips, may be a disgusting sight to an European,
unaccustomed to such objects.&nbsp; Let us only ask, As children,
<a name="page3_11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>have we
not, at some time or other, run affrighted from a Gipsey?&nbsp;
The case will be entirely altered, if we divest ourselves of the
idea that a black skin is disagreeable.&nbsp; Their white teeth;
their long black hair, on which they pride themselves very
highly, and will not suffer to be cut off; their lively black
rolling eyes;&mdash;are, without dispute, properties which must
be ranked among the list of beauties, even by the modern
civilised European world.&nbsp; They are neither overgrown
giants, nor diminutive dwarfs: their limbs are formed in the
justest proportion.&nbsp; Large bellies are, among them, as
uncommon as hump-backs, blindness, or other corporeal
defects.&nbsp; When Grisellini asserts that the breasts of the
Gipsey women, at the time of their nursing, increase to a larger
size than the child they support, it is an assertion destitute of
proof, and parallel with many other arguments he adduces to prove
the Gipseys are Egyptians.&nbsp; Probably he may have confounded
himself, by thinking of the Hottentots; the circumstance above
mentioned being true of them, though not of the Gipseys.&nbsp;
Every Gipsey is naturally endued with agility, great suppleness
in, and the free use of, his limbs: these qualities are
perceptible in his whole deportment, but in an extraordinary
degree whenever he happens to be surprised in an improper place:
in the act of thieving, with a stolen goose or fowl in his hand,
he runs off so nimbly, that, <a name="page3_12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>unless his pursuer be on horseback,
the Gipsey is sure to escape.&nbsp; These people are blessed with
an astonishingly good state of health.&nbsp; Neither wet nor dry
weather, heat nor cold, let the extremes follow each other never
so quickly, seems to have any effect on them.&nbsp; Gipseys are
fond of a great degree of heat; their supreme luxury is, to lie
day and night so near the fire, as to be in danger of burning: at
the same time they can bear to travel in the severest cold
bareheaded, with no other covering than a torn shirt, or some old
rags carelessly thrown over them, without fear of catching cold,
cough, or any other disorder.</p>
<p>By endeavouring to discover the causes of these bodily
qualities of the Gipseys, we find them, or at least some of them,
very evidently arising from their education and manner of
life.&nbsp; They are lean; but how should they be corpulent? as
they are seldom guilty of excess in eating or drinking; for if
they get a full meal to-day, they must not repine should they be
under the necessity of keeping fast to-morrow and the next
day.&nbsp; They have iron constitutions, because they have been
brought up hardily.&nbsp; The pitiless mother takes her
three-months-old child upon her back, and wanders about in fair
or foul weather, in heat or cold, without troubling her head what
may happen to it.&nbsp; When a boy attains the age of three
years, his lot becomes still harder.&nbsp; While an infant, and
his age reckoned by <a name="page3_13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>weeks and months, he was at least
wrapped up closely in rags; but now, deprived even of these, he
is, equally with his parents, exposed to the rigour of the
elements, for want of covering: he is now put to trial how far
his legs will carry him, and must be content to travel about,
with, at most, no other defence for his feet than thin
socks.&nbsp; Thus he grows up, and acquires his good health by
hardship and misery.&nbsp; We may as easily account for the
colour of the Gipsey&rsquo;s skin.&nbsp; The Laplanders,
Samoieds, as well as the Siberians, likewise, have brown
yellow-coloured skins, in consequence of living, from their
childhood, in smoke and dirt, in the same manner as the Gipseys:
these would, long ago, have been divested of their swarthy
complexions, if they had discontinued their filthy mode of
living.&nbsp; Only observe a Gipsey from his birth, till he
reaches man&rsquo;s estate; and you must be convinced that their
colour is not so much owing to their descent, as to the nastiness
of their bodies.&nbsp; In summer, the child is exposed to the
scorching sun; in winter, it is shut up in a smoky hut.&nbsp; It
is not uncommon for mothers to smear their children over with a
black ointment, and leave them to fry in the sun or near the
fire.&nbsp; They seldom trouble themselves about washing, or
other modes of cleaning themselves.&nbsp; Experience also shews
us, that the dark colour of the Gipseys, which is continued from
generation to generation, is more the effect of <a
name="page3_14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>education,
and manner of life, than descent.&nbsp; Among those who profess
music in Hungary, or serve in the Imperial army, where they have
learnt to pay more attention to order and cleanliness, there are
many to be found whose extraction is not at all discernible in
their colour; though they had, probably, remained to the age of
twelve or fourteen years under the care of their filthy parents;
and must necessarily, when they first adopted a different mode of
life, have borne the marks of the dirt contracted during this
period.&nbsp; How much less, then, should we be able to
distinguish a Gipsey if taken when a child from its sluttish
mother, and brought up under some cleanly person!&nbsp; By the
same reasoning we may account for their white teeth and sound
limbs; namely, from their manner of life.&nbsp; The former are
evidences of their spare diet: the latter prove them to have been
reared more according to the dictates of nature, than those of
art and tenderness.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>On their Food and Beverage</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> Gipseys who are more
connected with civilised people are not remarkable in their diet;
though it is to be observed of them, that they are by no means
particular in their cookery.&nbsp; The others, on the contrary,
have their table furnished in a very irregular and extraordinary
way.&nbsp; Sometimes they fast, or at best have only bread and
water to subsist upon: at other times they regale on fowls and
geese.&nbsp; The greatest luxury to them is, when they can
procure a roast of cattle that have died of any distemper.&nbsp;
It is the same to them, whether it be the carrion of a sheep,
hog, cow, or other beast, horse-flesh only excepted: they are so
far from being disgusted with it, that to eat their fill of such
a meal is to them the height of epicurism.&nbsp; When any person
censures their taste, or shews surprise at it, they answer,
&ldquo;The flesh of a beast which God kills, must be better than
that of one killed by the hand of man:&rdquo; they therefore
embrace every opportunity of getting such dainties.&nbsp; That
they take carrion from the laystalls, as is affirmed of the
Gipseys in Hungary, is not probable, any more than that they eat
horse flesh.&nbsp; But if a beast out of a herd die, and they
find it before it <a name="page3_16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>become rotten and putrefied; or if a farmer give them
notice of a cow dead in the stable; they proceed, without
hesitation, to get possession of the booty.&nbsp; They are
particularly fond of animals that have been destroyed by fire;
therefore, whenever a conflagration has happened, either in town
or country, the next day the Gipseys, from every neighbouring
quarter, assemble, and draw the suffocated, half consumed, beasts
out of the ashes.&nbsp; Men, women, and children, in troops, are
extremely busy, joyfully carrying the flesh home to their
dwellings: they return several times, provide themselves
plentifully with this roast meat, and gluttonise in their huts as
long as their noble fare lasts.&nbsp; Their manner of dressing
this delicious food is curious:&mdash;they boil or roast what is
intended for the first day; if they have more than they can
devour at once, the remainder is either dried in the sun, or
smoked in their huts, and eaten without any further
preparation.</p>
<p>Something might here be introduced concerning their relish for
human flesh, and the instances which some years ago happened in
Hungary might be adduced as proofs, <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a> were it not likely
to be objected, <a name="page3_17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>that these examples are at variance with common
experience, as well as with the old accounts handed down to us
concerning these people.&nbsp; We shall, therefore, not insist on
this accusation: but entirely give up the point of Gipseys being
men-eaters, except just hinting, that it would be expedient for
governments to be watchful.&nbsp; But the instances in Hungary do
not appear, by any means, so casual and uncommon as people may
imagine.&mdash;What, according to the strictest examination, has
been done, not by <i>one</i>, but <i>many</i>; not by <i>ten</i>,
but even <i>two hundred</i>, and perhaps by <i>thousands</i>; not
<i>yesterday</i> and <i>to-day</i>, but <i>many years back</i>;
finally, not <i>by the whole body together</i>, but <i>single
parties by themselves</i>, <i>in different places</i>: Shall
these things be deemed only casual excesses?&nbsp; Should it be
asserted, in addition to this, that eating human flesh is in
practice and allowed, in the country whence they originate; we
might with greater probability mention this shocking fact, of
feeding on human flesh, as a prevailing custom among the
Gipseys.&nbsp; This circumstance is expressly mentioned in
histories: which assure us, that <a name="page3_18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>among the particular class of people
from whom the Gipseys sprung, it is a long-established custom for
the nearest relations and friends to kill and eat each
other.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to bring proof of it in this
place, as it belongs to the second section: let it suffice just
to have hinted the matter, in order that it may be known towards
what people we are to look for the origin of the Gipseys.&nbsp;
As to the objection, that among all the crimes with which they
have been charged, in the older writings, <i>eating human
flesh</i> is not positively alledged against them, it may be
obviated by more than one answer.&nbsp; In the first place, let
it be observed, history relates, and the event in Hungary
confirms, that they murder one another; further, consider their
wandering mode of life; lastly, that they generally abide in
byplaces: and all may be easily accounted for.&nbsp; A hundred
fathers may sacrifice their children to their voluptuousness, and
the crime still remain concealed.&nbsp; The absent person is not
missed; as nobody watches over a family continually in motion,
and every-where a stranger.&nbsp; Just as unlikely is it, that
information should be given to government.&nbsp; There is no
reason to suppose any of their own people would think it their
duty to inform; as, not being contrary to their usual practice,
they do not esteem it wrong.&nbsp; It is very possible for them
to have destroyed many other people, without the circumstances
being recorded in the courts of <a name="page3_19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>justice, or noticed in the annual
publications.&nbsp; Who ever thought to enquire of them after any
traveller that, far distant from his own country, might have
fallen into their hands and been cut off?&nbsp; Or how are the
remains of the poor victim to be traced, if they devour what is
eatable, and burn the bones? <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a></p>
<p><a name="page3_20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Those
Hungarian wretches have, according to their own account, for
twelve years gratified their horrid cravings, undiscovered by the
magistrates, in a country where the police is by no means bad:
perhaps they might have continued unsuspected <a
name="page3_21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>for ever,
had they not laid their unlucky hands on the people of the
country, thereby bringing on a strict enquiry, and rendering the
discovery more easy.&nbsp; Nor do the older writings seem to be
entirely silent on this head; at least there is an appearance of
something of the kind in them.&nbsp; Many authors mention the
Gipseys stealing people, and accuse them particularly of lying in
wait for young children.&nbsp; Others again deny this, saying,
that the Gipseys have brats enough of their own, and therefore
have not the least reason to covet strange children.&nbsp; How
does the matter look, if we suppose they did not want to rear
these children, but to sacrifice them to their inordinate
appetite?&mdash;and the Hungarian intelligence expressly says,
they were particularly fond of young subjects.&nbsp; What renders
the truth of this accusation in the old writings suspicious, is,
that before even a single Gipsey had set his foot in Europe, the
Jews lay under the same imputation.&nbsp; Perhaps in this, as in
many other instances, the calumny invented against the Jews might
be afterwards transferred to the Gipseys.&nbsp; This alone
considered, the imputation of kidnapping children might become
doubtful; but then occurs the weighty circumstance, that it has
been judicially proved in England; and, in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, an act of parliament was passed on the occasion.&nbsp;
Enough of this; let people reason upon the cannibal appetite <a
name="page3_22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of the
Gipseys as they please, there will always remain ground for
suspicion.</p>
<p>After having shewn how little delicate they are in satisfying
their appetites, we should scarcely expect to find them squeamish
with regard to articles of diet that are highly esteemed among
civilised people.&nbsp; But Griselini gives a long catalogue of
things which, he says, are disagreeable to a Gipsey&rsquo;s
palate; among which, he particularly mentions beans and onions,
red bream, pearch, lampreys, with every kind of wild-fowl.&nbsp;
Whereas the fact is, Gipseys not only eat beans and onions, but
are very fond of them; and as for the red bream, pearch and
lampreys, pheasants, partridges, &amp;c. their only reason for
abstaining from them is, the difficulty of procuring them: in
which they are not singular; many other people being in the same
predicament.</p>
<p>The Gipseys are not much accustomed to baking of bread; that
is an article which they usually buy, beg or steal, or go
entirely without.&nbsp; If by chance they do bake, the business
is performed quite in the eastern method:&mdash;a wood fire is
made on the ground, which soon becomes embers; in the mean time
the mother kneads her dough, forms it into small cakes, lays them
on the hot ashes, and thus they are baked.</p>
<p>To eat with a knife and fork, is no part of a Gipsey&rsquo;s
politeness; nor is a table or plate <a name="page3_23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>thought necessary: even a dish is
frequently dispensed with.&nbsp; The whole kitchen and table
apparatus consists of an earthen pot, an iron pan (which is also
used as a dish), a knife, and a spoon.&nbsp; When the meal is
ready, all the family sit around the pot or pan, the boiled or
roast is divided into pieces, on which they fall-to; their teeth
and fingers serving them for knives and forks, as does the ground
for table and plates.</p>
<p>The common beverage of the Gipseys is water; now and then
beer, when it costs them nothing.&nbsp; Wine is too expensive,
nor is it particularly grateful to them.&nbsp; The case is very
different when brandy comes in question, of which they are
immoderately fond.&nbsp; They feel great pleasure in intoxicating
themselves; which being easiest and soonest effected with brandy,
it is in their esteem the only liquor worth purchasing: all they
can earn goes that way: and whenever by chance they become
possessed of a penny, it is expended at the first house where
brandy is to be met with.&nbsp; Every christening, wedding, or
other occasion of rejoicing, is solemnised with brandy: if they
have plenty of it, they, as it were, drive the world before them;
each trying, by screaming or holloing, to express his felicity
and consummate happiness.</p>
<p>But, however great the thirst the Gipseys have for brandy, it
is even exceeded by their immoderate love of tobacco.&nbsp; This
is not, as might be supposed, <a name="page3_24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>peculiar to the men; for the women
sometimes exceed them in it: and they not only smoke it, but chew
and swallow the very leaves and stalks, with great avidity.&nbsp;
That it may sooner reach its place of destination, and stimulate
the gums and tongue more forcibly, they use a pipe not longer
than ones finger: this pipe is made of wood, for economical
reasons&mdash;as it absorbs the moisture, and thereby becomes a
very great Gipsey delicacy; for having smoked it as long as they
choose, they gnaw it with astonishing greediness, till not a
splinter remains.&nbsp; It is immaterial, whether the pipe be
smoked by the person himself or another, to bring it to the
proper degree of perfection: he accepts it, as a valuable
present, from any body; and is so chary of it, that it frequently
lasts him many days.&nbsp; The Gipsey will abstain from food for
more than a day, when he can procure a leaf of tobacco, or a
piece of his pungent pipe, which he chews, drinks a little water,
and is happy.&nbsp; This surely exceeds every thing that has been
related of the most famous smoker!</p>

25</span>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>On the Dress of the Gipseys</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> cannot be expected that the
description of the dress of a set of people whose whole economy
belongs to the class of beggars, should exhibit any thing but
poverty and want.&nbsp; The first of them that came to Europe
appeared ragged and miserable&mdash;unless we perhaps allow their
leaders to have been an exception;&mdash;in like manner their
descendants have continued for hundreds of years, and still
remain.&nbsp; This is particularly remarkable in the countries
about the mouth of the Danube, which abound with Gipseys; namely,
Transylvania, Hungary, and Turkey in Europe, where they dress
even more negligently than in other parts.</p>
<p>The Gipseys consider a covering for the head as perfectly
useless: the wind will not easily blow his hat off, who never
wears any thing of the kind, excepting when he has a mind to make
a figure, and even then a rough cap usually supplies its
place.&nbsp; During the winter, if the female Gipseys do not knit
socks, which those in Moldavia and Wallachia do, with wooden
needles, he winds a couple of rags round his feet, which in
summer are laid aside as unnecessary.&nbsp; He is not better
furnished with linen, as the women neither spin, <a
name="page3_26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>sew, nor
wash.&nbsp; For want of change, what he once puts on his body,
remains till it falls off of itself.&nbsp; His whole dress often
consists of only a pair of breeches and a torn shirt.</p>
<p>We are not to suppose, from what is said above, that the
Gipseys are indifferent about dress; on the contrary, they love
fine clothes to an extravagant degree: the want proceeds from
necessity, which is become with them a second nature, forgetting
that labour and care are the means to procure clothes, as well as
nourishment.&nbsp; Whenever an opportunity offers of acquiring a
good coat, either by gift, purchase, or theft, the Gipsey
immediately bestirs himself to become master of it: possessed of
the prize, he puts it on directly, without considering in the
least, whether it suits the rest of his apparel.&nbsp; If his
dirty shirt had holes in it as big as a barn door, or his
breeches were so out of condition that one might perceive their
antiquity at the first glance; were he unprovided with shoes,
stockings, or a covering for the head; neither of these defects
would prevent his strutting about in a laced coat, feeling
himself of still greater consequence in case it happened to be a
red one.&nbsp; Martin Kelpius therefore says, that the Gipseys in
Transylvania spend all their earnings in alehouses and in
clothes.&nbsp; It would excite laughter in the sternest
philosopher, to see a Gipsey parading about, with a beaver hat, a
silk or red cloth coat, at the same time his <a
name="page3_27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>breeches
torn, and his shoes or boots, if perchance he have either,
covered with patches.</p>
<p>Benko, also, assures us, that this kind of state is common in
Transylvania; and adds, the Gipseys are particularly fond of
clothes made after the Hungarian fashion, or which had been worn
by people of distinction.&nbsp; The habits and properties of the
Gipseys in Hungary are precisely the same.&nbsp; The following
passage, which appeared in the Imperial Gazettes, is very much to
the purpose: &ldquo;Notwithstanding these people are so wretched,
that they have nothing but rags to cover them, which do not at
all fit, and are scarcely sufficient to hide their nakedness, yet
they betray their foolish taste and vain ostentation whenever
they have an opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Transylvania, some of them wear the Wallachian dress; but
in Hungary they are so attached to the habits of the country,
that a Gipsey had rather go half naked, or wrap himself up in a
sack, than he would condescend to wear a foreign garb, even
though a very good one were given to him.&nbsp; Green is a
favourite colour with the Gipseys; but scarlet is held in so
great esteem by them, that a man cannot appear abroad in a red
habit, though worn out, without being surrounded by a crowd old
and young, who, in the open street, are solicitous to purchase of
him, be it coat, pellisse, or breeches.&nbsp; Unless severely
pinched by the cold, or <a name="page3_28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>in case of the greatest necessity,
they will not deign to put on a boor&rsquo;s coat: they rather
choose to buy for their own use cast-off clothes; and if they
happen to be ornamented with lace or loops, they strut about in
such dresses, as proudly as if they were not merely lords of the
district, but of the whole creation.&nbsp; Thus all the money
they can spare, is expended in obtaining a sort of clothes not at
all becoming their station, and which answer no other purpose,
but to betray their weak silly notions, and expose them to the
ridicule of the more sensible part of mankind.&nbsp; They do not
pay the least regard to symmetry, nor care what reasonable people
think of their dress: provided they can only get something
shining to put on, that will catch the eye, they give themselves
no concern if the rest of their clothing be very bad, or though
they be nearly in a state of nudity.&nbsp; It is no uncommon
spectacle to see a Gipsey parading the streets in an embroidered
pellisse, or laced coat decorated with silver buttons, with a
dirty ragged shirt, barefooted, and without a hat; or with a pair
of embroidered scarlet breeches on, and perhaps no other covering
but half a shirt.</p>
<p>Nothing pleases Hungarian Gipseys more than a pair of yellow
(<i>tschischmen</i>) boots, and spurs: no sooner do the latter
glitter on his feet, but he bridles up, and marches
consequentially about, often eying his fine boots, at the same
time totally <a name="page3_29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>regardless of his breeches, which may have lost a
portion before or behind, or be in some other respects quite
shabby.</p>
<p>The usual dress of the women is no better than that of the
men; indeed they have generally been thought rather to go beyond
them in filth and nastiness.&nbsp; Their appearance is truly
disgusting to any civilised person: their whole covering consists
of, either a piece of linen thrown over the head and wound round
the thighs, or an old shift hung over them, through which their
smoky hides appear in numberless places.&nbsp; Sometimes, in
winter, they wrap themselves in a piece of woollen stuff like a
cloak.&nbsp; Occasionally, their dress partakes of the other sex;
as they do not hesitate to wear breeches, or other male
habilament.&nbsp; They use the same covering for the feet as the
men;&mdash;either a pair of coarse socks, knit with wooden
needles, which is commonly done in Moldavia and Wallachia; or
they sew them up in rags, which remain on till the stuff perishes
and falls off, or till spring arrives, at which season both men
and women go barefooted. <a name="citation29"></a><a
href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a></p>
<p>The women are as fond of dress as the men, and equally
ridiculous in their choice of it; they are often <a
name="page3_30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>seen in a
<i>dress cap</i>, while their rotten linen jacket scarcely serves
to cover their nakedness.&nbsp; In Spain, they plaster their
temples with great patches of black silk; and hang all sorts of
trumpery in their ears, besides a number of baubles about the
neck.</p>
<p>The Gipseys were at very little trouble respecting the dress
of their children; these ran about naked, in the true Calmuc
style, till ten years of age, when the boys got breeches, and the
girls aprons.&nbsp; But this nuisance is at an end in the
Imperial dominions, both in Germany and Hungary, where an order
to suppress it was issued out by the emperor Joseph.</p>
<p>Before we dismiss the subject of dress, we may mention a
laudable custom established among the Gipseys, in order to save
their clothes when they have quarreled, and mean to fight.&nbsp;
Before they proceed to action, a truce takes place for a minute
or two, to give the combatants time to strip to their shirts,
that their apparel may not suffer in the fray: then the storm
breaks loose, and each lays on the other as hard as he can.&nbsp;
The custom has this use in it, that whenever any body appears in
a ragged coat, he may affirm, on his honour, that it was not
rendered so in a Gipsey brawl.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>On the Family Economy of the
Gipseys</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> these people are still the
rude unpolished creatures that nature formed them, or, at most,
have only advanced one degree towards humanity, is evinced, with
other circumstances, by their family economy.</p>
<p>Many of the Gipseys are stationary, having regular
habitations, according to their situation in life.&nbsp; To this
class belong those who keep public-houses in Spain; and others in
Transylvania and Hungary, who follow some regular business; which
latter have their own miserable huts near Hermanstadt, Cronstadt,
Bistritz, Grosswaradein, Debrezin, Eperies, Karchau, and other
places.&nbsp; There are also many slaves, to particular bojars,
in Moldavia and Wallachia, who do not wander any more than the
others.&nbsp; But by far the greatest number of these people lead
a very different kind of life: ignorant of the comforts attending
a fixed place of residence, they rove from one district to
another in hordes, having no habitations but tents, holes in the
rocks, or caves; the former shade them in summer, the latter
screen them in winter.&nbsp; Many of these savage people,
particularly in Germany and Spain, do not even carry tents with
them, but <a name="page3_32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>shelter themselves, from the heat of the sun, in forests
shaded by the rocks, or behind hedges: they are very partial to
willows, under which they erect their sleeping place, at the
close of the evening.&nbsp; Some live in their tents (in their
language called <i>tschater</i>) during both summer and winter;
which indeed the Gipseys generally prefer.&nbsp; In Hungary, even
those who have discontinued their rambling way of life, and built
houses for themselves, seldom let a spring pass, without taking
advantage of the first settled weather, to set up a tent for
their summer residence; under this each one enjoys himself, with
his family, nor thinks of his house till the winter returns, and
the frost and snow drive him back to it again.</p>
<p>The wandering Gipsey, in Hungary and Transylvania, endeavours
to procure a horse; in Turkey, an ass serves to carry his wife, a
couple of children, with his tent.&nbsp; When he arrives at a
place he likes, near a village or city, he unpacks, pitches his
tent, ties his animal to a stake to graze, and remains some weeks
there: or if he do not find his station convenient, he breaks up
in a day or two, loads his beast, and looks out for a more
agreeable situation, near some other town.&nbsp; Indeed, it is
not always in his power to determine how long he will remain in
the same place; for the boors are apt to trouble him, on account
of fowls and geese he has made free with: it sometimes happens,
when he is very <a name="page3_33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>much at his ease, they sally out with bludgeons or
hedge-stakes, making use of such forcible arguments, that he does
not hesitate a moment to set up his staff a little farther off:
though, in general, the Gipseys are cunning enough, when they
have purloined any thing, or done mischief, to make off in time
before the villagers begin to suspect them.</p>
<p>For their winter huts, they dig holes in the ground, ten or
twelve feet deep; the roof is composed of rafters laid across,
which are covered with straw and sods: the stable, for the beast
which carried the tent in summer, is a shed built at the entrance
of the hollow, and closed up with dung and straw.&nbsp; This
shed, and a little opening rising above the roof of their
subterranean residence, to let out the smoke, are the only marks
by which a traveller can distinguish their dwellings.&nbsp; Both
in summer and winter, they contrive to have their habitation in
the neighbourhood of some village, or city.&nbsp; Their favourite
mode of building is against a hillock: the holes in the level
ground being only used in cases of necessity, when there is no
rising ground near the spot they have chosen to pass the winter
on.&nbsp; A Hungarian writer thus describes their method of
constructing the second sort of huts: &ldquo;They first dig a
hollow, about a fathom broad, far enough into the hillock to
bring their floor on a level with the rest of the plain, in order
to form a firm upright wall, for the back of the <a
name="page3_34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>building.&nbsp; Into the wall they fix a beam, about six
feet from, and parallel to, the floor; this beam reaches as far
as the intended depth of the house, seldom exceeding seven or
eight feet.&nbsp; One end being fast in the wall, the other rests
on, and is fixed to, a pillar or post driven into the
ground.&nbsp; When that is done, they lay boards, balks, or such
other wood as they can find, against it on each side, in form of
a pointed roof, which, viewed from a distance, exhibits a front
in the shape of an equilateral triangle.&nbsp; The business is
finished by covering the whole building with straw, sods, and
earth, to secure its inhabitants from the rain, snow, and
cold.&nbsp; They always contrive, when they can, to place their
edifice so as to front either the rising or mid-day sun; this
being the side where the opening is left for a door to go in and
out at, which is closed at night, either with a coarse woollen
cloth or a few boards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagination will easily conceive how dismal and horrid the
inside of such Gipsey huts must be to civilised humanity.&nbsp;
Air and daylight excluded, very damp, and full of filth, they
have more the appearance of wild beasts&rsquo; dens, that of the
habitations of intelligent beings.&nbsp; Rooms or separate
apartments are not even thought of; all is one open space: in the
middle is the fire, serving both for the purpose of cooking and
warmth; the father and <a name="page3_35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>mother lie half naked, the children
entirely so, round it.&nbsp; Chairs, tables, beds or bedsteads,
find no place here; they sit, eat, sleep, on the bare ground, or
at most spread an old blanket, or, in the Banat, a sheep-skin,
under them.&nbsp; Every fine day the door is set open for the sun
to shine in, which they continue watching so long as it is above
the horizon; when the day closes, they shut their door and
consign themselves over to rest.&nbsp; When the weather is cold,
or the snow prevents them opening the door, they make up the
fire, and sit round it till they fall asleep, without any more
light than it affords.</p>
<p>The furniture and property of the Gipseys have been already
described; they consist of an earthen pot, an iron pan, a spoon,
a jug, and a knife; when it happens that every thing is complete,
they sometimes add a dish: these serve for the whole
family.&nbsp; When the master of the house is a smith by trade,
as will be hereafter mentioned, he has a pair of bellows to blow
up his fire, a small stone anvil, a pair of tongs, and perhaps a
couple of hammers; add to these a few old tatters in which he
dresses himself, his knapsack, some pieces of torn bed-clothes,
his tent, with his antiquated jade, and you have a complete
catalogue of a nomadic Gipsey&rsquo;s estate.</p>
<p>Very little can be said respecting the domestic employment of
the women.&nbsp; The care of their <a name="page3_36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>children is the most trifling
concern: they neither wash, mend their clothes, nor clean their
utensils: they seldom bake: the whole of their business, then, is
reduced to&mdash;dressing their food and eating it, smoking
tobacco, prating, and sleeping.&nbsp; They continue during the
whole winter in their hut; but at the first croaking of the
frogs, they pull down their house, and decamp.</p>
<p>Such is the condition of the Gipseys who wander about in
Hungary, Turkey, and other countries; being no-where, or rather
every-where, at home.&nbsp; The remainder of these people who
have reconciled themselves to a settled mode of living, are in
much better circumstances, and infinitely more rational, than
those just described.&nbsp; It will be expected, that those
Spanish Gipseys who are innkeepers, and entertain strangers, are
more civilised; and it also holds good with regard to those in
Hungary and Transylvania who have different ways of gaining a
livelihood.&nbsp; Their habitations are conveniently divided into
chambers; and are furnished with tables, benches, decent kitchen
furniture, and other necessaries.&nbsp; The few who farm, or
breed cattle, have a plough and other implements of husbandry;
the others, what is necessary for carrying on their trade; though
even here you are not to expect superfluity: habitations,
clothes, every thing, indicate that their owners belong to the
class of poor.&nbsp; They are very partial to gold <a
name="page3_37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>and silver
plate, particularly silver cups; which is a disposition they have
in common with the wandering Gipseys: they let slip no
opportunity of acquiring something of the kind; and will even
starve themselves to procure it.&nbsp; Though they seem little
anxious to heap up riches for their children, yet these
frequently inherit a treasure of this sort, and are obliged in
their turn to preserve it as a sacred inheritance.&nbsp; The
ordinary, travelling Gipseys when in possession of such a piece
of plate, commonly bury it under the hearth of their dwelling, in
order to secure it.&nbsp; This inclination to deprive themselves
of necessaries, that they may possess a superfluity, as well as
many other of their customs, is curious, yet appears to be
ancient; and it was probably inherent in them when they were
first seen by Europeans.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Their Occupations and Trades</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> considering the means to which
the Gipseys have recourse to maintain themselves, we shall
perceive the reason why poverty and want are so generally their
lot; namely, their excessive indolence, and aversion from
industry.&nbsp; They abhor every kind of employment which is
laborious or requires application; and had rather suffer even
hunger and nakedness, than obviate these privations on such hard
terms.&nbsp; They therefore either choose some profession which
requires little exertion, allowing them many idle hours; or
addict themselves to unlawful courses, and vicious habits.</p>
<p>Working in iron, is the most usual occupation of the
Gipseys.&nbsp; In Spain, very few follow any regular business;
but among these few, some are smiths: on the contrary, in Hungary
this profession is so common among them, that there is a
proverb&mdash;&lsquo;So many Gipseys, so many smiths:&rsquo; the
same might be said of those in Transylvania, Wallachia, Moldavia,
and all Turkey in Europe; at least such workers in fire are very
numerous in all those countries.&nbsp; This occupation seems to
have been a favourite with them from the most distant periods, as
appears not only by Bellonius&rsquo;s account, <a
name="page3_39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>but by an
older record, of an Hungarian king Uladislaus, in the year 1496,
mentioned by the Abb&eacute; Pray, in his Annals, and
Friedwaldsky, in his Mineralogy, wherein it is ordered, <i>that
every officer and subject</i>, <i>of whatever rank or
condition</i>, <i>do allow to Thomas Polgar</i>, <i>leader of
twenty-five tents of wandering Gipseys</i>, <i>free residence
everywhere</i>, <i>and on no account to molest either him or his
people</i>; <i>because they had prepared musket bullets</i>,
<i>and other military stores</i>, <i>for the Bishop
Sigismund</i>, <i>at F&uuml;nfkirchen</i>.&nbsp; Another instance
occurred in the year 1565, when Mustapha, Turkish regent of
Bosnia, besieged Crupa; the Turks having expended their powder
and cannon balls, Gipseys were employed to make the latter, part
of iron, the rest of stone cased with lead.</p>
<p>The Gipseys of our time are not willing to undertake heavy
work; they seldom go beyond a pair of light horse-shoes: in
general, they confine themselves to small articles, such as
rings, jews-harps, and small nails: they mend old pots and
kettles, make knives, seals, needles, and sometimes work trifles
in tin or brass.</p>
<p>Their materials, tools, apparatus, all are bad, and of the
most inferior kind.&nbsp; Their common method of proceeding is,
to collect some pieces of rusty iron, old nails, broken
horse-shoes, and such-like, which they fuse and shape to their
purpose.&nbsp; The anvil is a stone; the other implements <a
name="page3_40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>are, a pair
of hand-bellows, a pair of pincers, a hammer, a vice, and a file:
these are the tools which a nomadic Gipsey carries with him in
his perambulations.&nbsp; Whenever he is disposed to work, he is
at no loss for fuel: on his arrival at a station where he
purposes remaining a few days, or perhaps weeks, he takes his
beast, loads him with wood, builds a small kiln, and prepares his
own coals.&nbsp; In favourable weather, his work is carried on in
the open air; when it is stormy, or the sun too powerful, he
retires under his tent.&nbsp; He does not stand, but sits down on
the ground, cross-legged, to his work; which position is rendered
necessary, not only by custom, but by the quality of his
tools.&nbsp; The wife sits by to work the bellows, in which
operation she is sometimes relieved by the elder children; the
little ones sit, naked as they were born, round the fire.&nbsp;
The Gipseys are generally praised for their dexterity and
quickness, notwithstanding the wretched tools they have to
operate with.&nbsp; When any piece of work requires much time to
finish, they are apt to lose their patience, and in that case
become indifferent whether it be well executed or not.&nbsp; They
never submit to labour so long as they have got a dry crust, or
any thing else to satisfy their hunger.&nbsp; They frequently
receive orders to fabricate different articles; but if not, no
sooner are a few nails, or some other trifles, manufactured, than
<a name="page3_41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>man,
woman, and children, dislodge, to convey their merchandise, from
house to house, for sale, in the neighbouring villages: their
traffick is carried on sometimes for ready money, sometimes by
barter for eatables or other necessaries.</p>
<p>Another branch of commerce much followed by the Gipseys is
horse dealing, to which they seem to have been attached from the
earliest period of their history.&nbsp; In those parts of Hungary
where the climate is so mild that horses may lie out all the
year, the Gipseys avail themselves of this circumstance to breed,
as well as deal in, those animals; by which they sometimes not
only procure a competence, but grow rich.&nbsp; Instances have
been known on the Continent of Gipseys keeping from fifty to
seventy horses each, and those the best bred horses of the
country; some of which they let out for hire, others they sold or
exchanged, as occasion offered.&nbsp; But this description of
Gipsey horse-dealers is not very numerous; for the greatest
number of them deal only in blind worn-out jades, which they
drive about to different markets, to sell or barter.&nbsp; When
the dealer is not fortunate enough to find a chap for his nag, he
leads him to the collar-maker, who values the hide, and takes him
off his hands for a few groschens.&nbsp; In order to prevent
being reduced to this necessity, the slyest tricks are practised
to conceal the animal&rsquo;s defects.&nbsp; In Spain, therefore,
<i>Gitano</i> and <i>Gitaneria</i> <a name="page3_42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>(Gipsey and Gipseyism) are become
familiar expressions to imply a cheater in horses, with the
deceptions he makes use of.&nbsp; In the year 1727 they had
become so infamous in Sweden, that the subject was thought of
sufficient consequence for the consideration of the diet, and
their total expulsion was voted to be a necessary measure.&nbsp;
The following trick is frequently played in Hungary, and the
adjacent country, to make a horse appear brisk and
active:&mdash;the rider alights at a small distance from the
place where he means to offer his horse for sale, and belabours
him till he has put the whole muscular system in motion with
fright; he then mounts again, and proceeds.&nbsp; The poor beast
remembering the blows he has received, jumps about, or sets out
full speed, at the least signal; the buyer, entirely ignorant of
the preparatory discipline the animal has undergone, supposes
this to be natural vivacity, and in hopes that good feeding, with
care, will render him still more lively, strikes a bargain: but
the next day he has the mortification to discover that he has
bought a jade, on which all his care will be thrown away, as the
beast has not a leg to stand upon.&nbsp; In Suabia, and on the
Rhine, they have another device:&mdash;they make an incision in
some hidden part of the skin, through which they blow the
creature up, till he looks fleshy and plump; they then apply a
strong sticking-plaster, to prevent the air from <a
name="page3_43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>returning.&nbsp; If what Wolfgang Franz assures us be
true, they sometimes make use of a trick with a live eel, to this
blown-up horse, that he may not only appear in good condition,
but spirited and lively.&nbsp; It might be thought, that, on
account of these and such-like roguish proceedings, nobody would
ever venture to deal with a Gipsey for a horse, were not the
possibility proved by the fact itself.&nbsp; But we see instances
of this infatuation in other transactions: it is well known that
every Jew will cheat, whenever he has an opportunity; yet these
people have lived by trade, ever since their dispersion from
Babel.&nbsp; Then, these frauds do not always happen: the Gipseys
too sell their horses cheap; and as poor people cannot afford to
pay dear for them, they must buy where they can; and thus the
Gipseys are enabled to continue their traffick.</p>
<p>To the two professions before mentioned as commonly followed
by the men, may be added, those of carpenters and turners: the
former make watering-troughs and chests; the latter turn
trenchers, dishes, make spoons and other trifling articles, which
they hawk about.&nbsp; There are others who make sieves, or
maintain themselves by cobbling shoes.&nbsp; Many of these, as
well as the blacksmiths and whitesmiths, find constant employment
in the houses of the better sort of people, for whom they work
the year round.&nbsp; They are not paid in <a
name="page3_44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>money; but,
beside other advantages, find a certain subsistence.&nbsp; Those
who are not thus circumstanced, do not wait at home for
customers, but, with their implements in a sack thrown over their
shoulders, seek business in the cities or villages: when any one
calls, they throw down the bundle, and prepare the apparatus for
work, before the door of their employer.</p>
<p>The Gipseys have a fixed dislike to agriculture; and had
rather suffer hunger, or any privation, than follow the plough,
to earn a decent livelihood.&nbsp; But, as there is no general
rule without an exception, so, beside the slaves to the bojars in
Moldavia and Wallachia, who are constrained to apply to it, there
are some in Hungary who are cultivators by choice.&nbsp; Since
the year 1768, the Empress Theresa has commanded that the
Hungarian and Transylvanian Gipseys should be instructed in
husbandry; but these orders have been very little regarded.&nbsp;
At this time there are so few of them farmers, in those parts,
that they are undeserving of notice; though in Spain, and other
European countries, they are still more scarce, as it would be
difficult to find one who had ever made a furrow in his life.</p>
<p>Formerly, Gipseys were commonly employed in Hungary, and in
Transylvania almost universally, for hangmen and
executioners.&nbsp; They still perform the business of flayers in
Hungary, and of executioners in <a name="page3_45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>different parts of
Transylvania.&nbsp; Their assiduity in torturing, their cruel
invention in tormenting, are described by Toppeltin to be so
shocking, that the Gipseys seem eminently calculated for works of
barbarity.&nbsp; They do not follow flaying as a regular
profession any-where; it is merely a casual occupation, in
addition to their usual employment.&nbsp; Whenever a beast dies
near where they happen to be, it is a fortunate circumstance if
there be no skinner in the place; not because they can make much
of the skin, which they always leave with the owner for a
trifling consideration, but they are thus enabled to procure a
plentiful provision of flesh for the family.</p>
<p>Such are the employments of the men.&nbsp; We shall now
proceed to shew the particular methods the women have of
obtaining support.&nbsp; It was formerly, and still is, the
custom, among the wandering Gipseys, especially in winter, not
for the man to maintain the wife, but the wife the husband.&nbsp;
This is not precisely the fact in summer, when the men have the
before-recited occupations; nor among those who have a regular
settlement; but the women always endeavour to contribute their
share towards the maintenance of the family: some deal in old
clothes; others frequent brothels, which is commonly the case in
Spain, and still more so in Constantinople, and all over
Turkey.&nbsp; There are others, in Constantinople, who make and
sell brooms; but <a name="page3_46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>this trade is followed by those chiefly who are too old
to get a livelihood by their debauchery.&nbsp; Dancing is another
means they have of obtaining contributions: they generally
practise this when begging, particularly of men, in the streets;
or when they enter houses, to ask charity.&nbsp; Their dancing is
the most disgusting that can be conceived, always ending with
fulsome grimaces, or the most lascivious attitudes and gestures:
nor is this indecency confined to the married women, but is
rather more practised by young girls, travelling with their
fathers, who are also musicians, and who, for a trifling
acknowledgement, will exhibit their dexterity to any body who is
pleased with these unseemly dances.&nbsp; They are trained up to
this impudence from their earliest years, never suffering a
passenger to pass their parents&rsquo; hut, without endeavouring
to obtain something by frisking about naked before him.</p>
<p>Respecting fortune telling, with which the female Gipseys
impose on people&rsquo;s credulity, in every district and corner
of Europe, little need be said.&nbsp; Yet it is extraordinary,
that <i>women</i>, generally too not till they become old, should
be so sharpsighted as to discover, in every person&rsquo;s hand
they are permitted to inspect, the events of futurity!&nbsp;
There are some instances of men being thus gifted; but so few,
that they are only exceptions to a general rule.&nbsp; It is,
therefore, to be ascribed to the Gipsey women <a
name="page3_47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>alone, that
faith in divination still exists in the minds of millions of
people.&nbsp; It is true, Europe was not originally beholden to
the Gipseys for this faith, it being deeply rooted in the
ignorance of the middle age, when they arrived and brought it
with them also.&nbsp; The science of divination here, was already
brought to a much greater degree of perfection than among them:
rules were invented to tell lies from the inspection of the hand;
whereas these poor wretches were esteemed mere bunglers.&nbsp;
During the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century
the Gipseys were considered as only a supernumerary party; there
being men of great learning, who not only read lectures in
college on the divine art of chiromancy, but wrote many books,
vilifying these people, and endeavouring to spoil their market by
exposing their ignorance.&nbsp; But those enlightened men are no
more; their knowledge is deposited in the dead archives of
literature: and probably, if there were no Gipseys, with them
would also have died the belief in chiromancy, as has happened in
regard to astrology, necromancy, oneirocritica, and the other
offsprings of imbecile fancy.&nbsp; By the Gipseys alone will
this deceit be kept alive, till every Gipsey is constrained to
acknowledge some country, and to have some ostensible mode of
gaining a livelihood.&nbsp; We can only pity the poor weak
deluded beings, who pay their groschen or kreutzer, their
shilling <a name="page3_48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>or sixpence, for a few unmeaning words!&mdash;as if it
were possible for people to instruct us concerning our future
fortune in life, who are ignorant of their own; being unable to
determine whether a day or two hence, they may still be telling
fortunes, or be taken before the magistrates, and hanged for
theft.</p>
<p>In addition to the chiromantic deception of the Gipsey women,
they also&mdash;though not exclusively, as the men likewise often
profess the same talent&mdash;cure bewitched cattle, discover
thefts, and possess nostrums of various kinds, to which they
ascribe great virtues.&nbsp; These nostrums consist principally
of roots, and amulets made of unfermented dough, marked with
strange figures, and dried in the air.&nbsp; Griselini says,
that, in the Banat of Temeswar, they sell certain small stones,
chiefly a kind of scori&aelig;, which they say possess the
quality of rendering the wearer fortunate in love, play,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Were that true, why deliver to others what they
have so much occasion for themselves?&nbsp; Why do they beg and
steal, when, with the assistance of these stones, they might
honourably acquire riches, and good fortune?&nbsp; Yet these
stones are purchased with avidity, not only in the Banat, but in
Germany.&nbsp; People use their quack medicines; call the Gipsey
woman into the stable, to exorcise their bewitched cattle,
without suspecting any trick or deception.&nbsp; So the
open-hearted farmer, <a name="page3_49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>in Suabia and Bavaria, has recourse
to the Gipseys on many occasions, employing them as doctors for
man and beast; and constantly, in cases of supposed enchantment,
flies to the Gipsey: this circumstance happens most frequently
among those of the common people who pretend to have the least
belief in witches and witchcraft.&nbsp; Whenever a cow does not
feed kindly, something is immediately suspected; and the Gipsey
woman is called, who is often so successful as to remove the
impediment.&nbsp; She goes into the stable, orders the cow to be
shewn to her, and, after desiring every one else to go out,
remains a few minutes alone with it: having finished her
operations, she calls in the master, acquaints him with the
beast&rsquo;s recovery, and behold it eats heartily!&nbsp; How
happens this?&nbsp; Was it not a piece of enchantment, wherein
the Gipsey really acted the magician?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp;
The fraud is this:&mdash;When the cattle are feeding abroad, the
Gipsey woman takes advantage of the keepers absence to entice
some of them, with a handful of fodder, to follow her; she then
smears them, over the nose and mouth, with some filthy
composition, which she has ready in the other hand.&nbsp; From
that moment the creature loaths all kinds of food and
drink.&nbsp; When the Gipsey is called in to apply a remedy, the
whole skill required, is to cleanse the animal&rsquo;s nose and
mouth from the stuff she had put on a day or two before: <a
name="page3_50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>by this
means the true smell is restored, and the cow being hungry, it is
not surprising she should fall-to greedily.&nbsp; From this
single instance, a judgment may be formed of other cases.</p>
<p>The more common Gipsey occupations, wherein the men and women
take an equal share, are&mdash;in Spain, keeping inns;
principally music in Hungary and Turkey; and gold-washing in
Transylvania, the Banat, Moldavia, and Wallachia.&nbsp; The
Gipseys, formerly, were concerned in smuggling; and probably
still are, although it is not mentioned by late writers.</p>
<p>Both male and female Gipseys attend at entertainments with
their music, and often shew great proficiency in the art: besides
some wind instrument, they have generally a violin; and many of
them have attained so great perfection on that instrument, as to
be employed in the chapels of the nobility, and admired as great
masters.&nbsp; <i>Barna Mihaly</i>, in the country of Zips, who
distinguished himself, about the middle of the last century, in
the chapel of the cardinal Count <i>Emerick von Cschaky</i>, was
an Orpheus of this kind.&nbsp; The cardinal, who was a judge of
music himself, had so great a regard for him, that he had his
likeness taken by one of the most capital painters.&nbsp;
Instances of the kind are not wanting in the other sex: it is
well known that a Gipsey girl, at fourteen years of age, was so
famous as a fidler, that <a name="page3_51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the greatest and most fashionable
people in Hungary were accustomed to send twenty or thirty miles
for her, to play at their balls.&nbsp; There are likewise very
many <i>scrapers</i>; these are generally such as have learned of
other scrapers, at their own expense.&nbsp; This kind of
musicians travel about, with the dancers before mentioned; or
play to the peasants, who, not having much taste, always make
them welcome at their weddings, or dances.&nbsp; They scratch
away on an old patched violin, or rumble on a broken base,
neither caring about better instruments, nor minding to stop in
tune; being what they are, more for want of application than
capacity.&nbsp; Others practise vocal music; and some have
acquired considerable fortunes, particularly in Spain, by
singing.</p>
<p>Goldwashing, in the rivers, is another occupation, by which
many thousand Gipseys, of both sexes, procure a livelihood, in
the Banat, Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia.&nbsp; As this
is only a summer employment, they are under the necessity of
finding some other means of supporting themselves during the
winter.&nbsp; It is not permitted for every one, without
exception, to be a goldwasher: in Transylvania, such only can
follow the employment, who have leave from the office of Mons; <a
name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a> and these only enjoy the privilege
under <a name="page3_52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>certain restrictions.&nbsp; In Wallachia and Moldavia,
none of the bojars&rsquo; slaves, thence called <i>bojaresk</i>
(bojar Gipseys), are suffered to meddle with goldwashing; that
being a liberty granted only to those who, like other subjects,
are immediately under the prince, denominated <i>domnesk</i>
(princely Gipseys): which are also subdivided into three classes;
the first named <i>Rudar</i>; the second <i>Ursar</i>; and the
third <i>Lajaschen</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Radars</i> alone have the
licence above mentioned; the others are obliged to seek a
different means of obtaining support.&nbsp; Each person is forced
to pay a certain tribute to government.&nbsp; The goldwashers in
Transylvania and the Banat pay four guilders annually, which is
discharged in gold-dust: the same sum is due from every Gipsey,
though many evade the contribution.&nbsp; When the time for
payment approaches; they contrive to keep out of the way,
particularly the Hungarian Gipseys.&nbsp; The tribute collected
in Wallachia and Moldavia does not go into the public treasury,
but belongs to the princesses for pin-money.&nbsp; In
Cantemir&rsquo;s time, that in Moldavia produced yearly one
thousand six hundred drachms: and the consort of the Wallachian
hospodar Stephen Rakowitza, in the year 1764, received from her
Rudars, two hundred and forty in number, twelve hundred and
fifty-four drachms;&mdash;a sum, according to General von Bauer
and Sulzer, amounting to one thousand and three drachms, <a
name="page3_53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>fine
gold.&nbsp; What the Gipseys in Wallachia and Moldavia get more
than their head-money, goes to the grand armasch, at two
lion-guilders the drachm: this he afterwards sells again, at a
higher price, according with its real value; as General von Bauer
believes, for his own profit, not for that of the prince.&nbsp;
The goldwashers in the Banat and Transylvania dispose of their
share at the royal redemption-office, in Zalatnya.&nbsp; The
earnings of these people vary with time and at different places;
during heavy rains and floods they are usually most successful:
besides, their profit is more or less, according to the quality
of the river they wash in.&nbsp; At the most favourable times,
viz. at the floods, Griselini calculates their daily gain not to
exceed three groschens.&nbsp; If we understand, as we certainly
ought, that this sum is not earned by each person, but by a whole
family, the statement will agree, pretty nearly, with Mr.
Dembscher&rsquo;s account: he says, &ldquo;In the year 1770 there
were, in the districts of Uj-Palanka, Orsova, and Caransebes,
upwards of eighty goldwashers, all of whom had families, and
followed the business, with their wives and children; yet this
number of hands delivered in only six or seven hundred ducats
worth of gold.&rdquo;&nbsp; Take half of the doubtful seventh
hundred; deduct three hundred and twenty guilders, head money,
from the gross sum; divide the remainder <a
name="page3_54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>among
eighty families, and each will receive yearly thirty-two
guilders: allot to each day, in the summer half-year, its
proportion, and it will be found very little more or less than
three groschens.&nbsp; As before stated, the labour of two
hundred Rudars produced, in the year 1764, twelve hundred
fifty-four drachms: General von Bauer adds, this sum was exactly
the half of what was collected, over the whole country, in the
same year.&nbsp; Now as these Gipseys were under the necessity of
parting with their twelve or thirteen hundred drachms, which
remained after the capitation tax was paid, to the grand-armasch,
at the rate of two lion-guilders per drachm, they earned still
less than those in the Banat; although the rivers in Wallachia
contain a sufficient plenty of gold to have enabled them to make
ten times that advantage, did not their laziness prevent
them.&nbsp; The Transylvanian rivers yield the most gold: there
are annually, from eight to ten hundred weight separated from
their sand, which are brought to Zalatnya, to be disposed
of.&nbsp; As this quantity is not obtained by Gipseys only, but
together with the Wallachians, and we have no account of the
gross number of goldwashers, how many of them are Gipseys, nor
what proportion they have of these eight hundred weight, it is
impossible to ascertain the profits of the Transylvanian Gipsey
goldwashers.&nbsp; That they are better off than those <a
name="page3_55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>in the
Banat and other places, is certain, from the circumstance of the
rivers abounding more with gold, than elsewhere.</p>
<p>It may not be uninteresting in this place to give the process
of goldwashing, in the words of those who, as mineralogists, have
superintended the work.&nbsp; The account communicated by the
Councellor von Kotzian, concerning the goldwashing in the Banat,
is as follows: &ldquo;The operation consists in, first, providing
a board of lime-wood, about one fathom long, and half a fathom
broad; being hollowed at the upper end, in the form of a dish,
from which are cut ten or twelve channels, in an oblique
direction.&nbsp; This board is fixed in an inclined position so
as to form an angle of forty-five degrees with the horizon.&nbsp;
The sand containing the gold, being laid in the hollow at the top
of the board, a quantity of water is then poured upon it, which
carries off the lighter parts; such as are more heavy they shove
down by hand: what remains in the channels, or furrows, is
discharged into an oblong tray, carried to the straining-trough,
and the gold which remains picked clean out.&nbsp; The whole of
this work is performed in so careless a manner, that much pure
gold is lost: it is, moreover, to be lamented, that the Gipseys
get only the gold which is perfectly separated from the sand, but
by no means any that sticks to <a name="page3_56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the ore, which they throw away,
though there is gold in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it seems evident, from the foregoing statement, that this
method is very inadequate to the purpose, and that consequently
much gold must be wasted, we are the more surprised when another
author, in the following words, assures us of the
contrary:&mdash;&ldquo;So negligent and careless as the work of
the Gipseys appears at first sight, just as effectual it is
proved when put to the test.&nbsp; Daily practice gives to these
people a degree of discernment, without which another person
would think they must lose a great deal.&nbsp; I convinced myself
in the following manner: When they had finished their washing on
the board&mdash;for which they commonly used from fifteen to
twenty troughs of coarse stuff&mdash;I divided the washed stuff
into three parcels; the ten or fifteen uppermost furrows always
contained the most gold, the second division not more than an
eighth part as much, but the last fifteen to twenty furrows
scarcely three grains.&nbsp; I have also narrowly examined the
refuse, and very seldom found any traces of gold in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The art of goldwashing is brought to much greater perfection
in Transylvania.&nbsp; In the description of the process adopted
in that country, it is said that all the rivers, brooks, and even
the pools which the rain forms, produce gold: <a
name="page3_57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>of these
the river Aranyosch is the richest, insomuch that the historians
have compared it to the Tagus and Pactolus.&nbsp; Excepting the
Wallachians, who live by the rivers, the goldwashers consist
chiefly of Gipseys.&nbsp; They can judge with the greatest
certitude where to wash to advantage.&nbsp; The apparatus used by
them for this work is a crooked board, four or five feet long, by
two or three broad, generally provided with a wooden rim on each
side; over this board they spread a woollen cloth, and scatter
the gold-sand, mixed with water, upon it: the small grains of the
metal remain sticking to the cloth, which they afterwards wash in
a vessel of water, and then separate the gold by means of the
trough.&nbsp; When larger particles of sand are found in their
washing, they make deeper channels in the middle of their crooked
boards, to stop the small pieces as they roll down: they closely
examine these small stones, and some are frequently found to have
solid gold fixed in them.</p>
<p>Those we have mentioned are the customary professions and
occupations of Gipseys, in the different countries and states of
Europe.&nbsp; But people must not imagine that their
smiths&rsquo; shops are continually resounding with the hammer;
nor that those of other professions are so attentive to their
callings, as to provide even a daily subsistence, not to think of
a comfortable maintenance.&nbsp; <a name="page3_58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Their consummate laziness, on the
contrary, as before observed, occasions so many idle hours in the
day, that their family is often reduced to the greatest distress;
for which reason, begging or stealing is by far a more common
method, than diligence or assiduous application to business, for
quieting the cravings of hunger.&nbsp; If we except soldiers, who
are kept in order by the discipline of the corporal, with some of
the Transylvanian goldwashers, who apply to music&mdash;and,
living separate from their own caste, in constant habits of
intercourse with people of a better sort, have thereby acquired
more civilised manners, and learned the distinction, if not
between right and wrong, at least between social honour and
disgrace&mdash;the remainder are, in the most unlimited sense,
arrant thieves.&nbsp; In fact, working at any trade, or
employment, seems to be merely a disguise, in order the better to
enable them to carry on their thieving practices; as the articles
which they prepare for sale in the cities and villages, furnish
an excellent excuse for sneaking into houses, to pry where there
is any thing which they may appropriate to themselves.&nbsp; This
kind of artifice is particularly the province of the women, who
have always been reckoned more dextrous than the men in the art
of stealing.&nbsp; They commonly take children with them, who are
tutored to remain behind, in the outer part of the house, to
purloin what they can, <a name="page3_59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>while the mother is negotiating in
the chamber.&nbsp; It is generally the women&rsquo;s office to
make away with the boor&rsquo;s geese and fowls, when they are to
be found in a convenient place.&nbsp; Should the creature make a
noise when seized, it is killed and dressed for the consumption
of the family; but if, by chance, it have strayed so far from the
village, that its crying cannot give any alarm, they keep it
alive to sell at the next market town.&nbsp; Winter is the time
when the women generally are most called upon to try their skill
in this way: during that season, many of the men remain in their
huts, sending the women abroad to forage.&nbsp; They go about in
the guise of beggars&mdash;a character they well know how to
support&mdash;and commonly carry with them a couple of children,
miserably exposed to the cold and frost; one of these is led by
the hand, the other tied in a cloth to the woman&rsquo;s back, in
order to excite compassion in well-disposed people.&nbsp; Whole
troops of these Gipsey beggars are met with in Spain; and the
encounter is by no means pleasant, as they ask alms in a manner,
and with such importunity, as if they thought you could not deny
them.&nbsp; They also tell fortunes; and impose on the credulous
with amulets.&nbsp; Besides all this, they seldom return to their
husbands without some pilfered booty.&nbsp; Many writers confine
the thefts of the Gipseys to small maters, and will not allow
that they are ever guilty of violence.&nbsp; <a
name="page3_60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>This is not
only denied by the testimony of others, but absolutely
contradicted by some recent instances.&nbsp; It is true that, on
account of their natural timidity, they do hesitate to commit a
robbery which appears to be attended with great danger, nor do
they often break open houses by night: they rather confine
themselves to petty depredations, than, as they think, rush
voluntarily into destruction by a great and dangerous
action.&nbsp; Yet we have more than one proof, that they make no
scruple to murder a traveller, or plunder cities and
villages.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>On their Marriages and Education</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are not, perhaps, any other
people among whom marriages are contracted with so little
consideration, or solemnised with so little ceremony, as among
the Gipseys.&nbsp; No sooner has a boy attained the age of
fourteen or fifteen years, than he begins to perceive that
something more than mere eating and drinking is necessary to
him.&nbsp; Having no fear of consequences, nor being under any
restraint from his parents, he forms a connection with the girl
he most fancies, of twelve, or at most thirteen, years old,
without any scruple of conscience, whether she be his nearest
relation, or an entire stranger; but it is to be observed, that a
Gipsey never marries a person who is not of the true Gipsey
breed.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s commandments are unknown to him; and
human laws cannot have much influence over one who lives in a
desert, remote from the observation of any ruling power.&nbsp;
The term of courtship is very short, often only long enough for
the parties to communicate their mutual inclination.&nbsp; They
do not wait for any marriage ceremony, as it is a matter of no
consequence to them, whether it be performed afterwards, or not
at all.&nbsp; Yet they do not seem to be entirely indifferent
about matrimony, <a name="page3_62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>not on account of conforming to any institution, but
from a pride they have in imitating what is done by other people,
lest they should appear to be inferior to them.&nbsp; As the very
early age of the parties, or some other irregularity, might meet
with objections from a regular clergyman, they frequently get one
of their own people to act the priest, and tack the decent couple
together.&nbsp; A marriage being thus accomplished, the man
provides a stone for an anvil, a pair of pincers, a file, and
hammers away as a smith; or works at some other trade, he may
have just learned from his father: then begins his
peregrination.&nbsp; Should his wife commit a fault at a future
time, he gives her half a dozen boxes on the ear; or very likely,
for some trifling cause, turns her off entirely.&nbsp; Her
conduct must, in general, be very much regulated by his will; and
she is obliged to be more attentive to him than to herself.&nbsp;
When the woman lies-in, which happens frequently, these people
being remarkably prolific, the child is brought forth, either in
their miserable hut, or, according to circumstances, it may be in
the open air, but always easily and fortunately: a woman of the
same kind performs the office of midwife.&nbsp; True Gipsey like,
for want of some vessel, they dig a hole in the ground, which is
filled up with cold water, and the new-born child washed in
it.&nbsp; This being done, it is wrapped up in some old rags,
which the motherly foresight has taken care to provide.&nbsp; <a
name="page3_63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Next comes
the christening, at which ceremony they prefer strangers, for
witnesses, rather than their own caste: but what kind of folks
their guests are, may be collected from the mode of entertaining
them.&nbsp; When the christening is over, the father takes the
sponsors to an alehouse, or if none be near, to some other house,
where he treats them with cakes and brandy.&nbsp; If he is a
little above the lowest state of misery, and has a mind to be
generous, other things are provided; but he does not join the
company, being employed in serving his guests.&nbsp; Thus the
affair ends.&nbsp; The lying-in woman passes her short time of
confinement, seldom exceeding eight days, with her child, in the
hut, or under a tent, in the smoke by the fire.&nbsp;
Refreshments are often sent from the godfathers and godmothers;
yet they are sometimes so uncivil, that they do not hesitate to
quarrel with them or even to discharge them from the trust, if
they think the present too small, or do not like the
provisions.&nbsp; When this happens, they have another
christening, in some other place; nay, sometimes even a
third.</p>
<p>Gipsey women, as already mentioned, frequently smear their
children over with a particular kind of ointment, and then lay
them in the sun, or before the fire, in order that the skin may
be more completely parched, and their black beauty thereby
increased.&nbsp; They never use a cradle, nor even <a
name="page3_64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>possess
such a piece of furniture; the child sleeps in its mother&rsquo;s
arms, or on the ground.&nbsp; When the lying-in is over, the
Gipsey woman goes to church, and thence, immediately, either to
begging or stealing.&nbsp; While the child remains in her arms,
perhaps imagining that people will be less severe in their
chastisements, she is more rapacious than at other times, and
takes whatever she can lay her hands on.&nbsp; If she cannot
escape without a beating, she endeavours to screen herself by
holding up the child to receive the blows, till she finds an
opportunity of retiring imperceptibly, and running away.</p>
<p>When the child gets a little stronger, and has attained the
age of three or four months, the mother seldom carries it on the
arm, but at her back; there it sits, winter and summer, in a
linen rag, with its head over her shoulder.&nbsp; If she have
more children, in course of time, which is generally the case, as
this race of beings is so prolifick, she leads one or two by the
hand, while such as are older run by her side; and thus attended,
she strolls through the villages and into houses.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding their dark complexion, and bad nursing, writers
are unanimous in stating, that these children are good-looking,
well shaped, lively, clever, and have fine eyes.&nbsp; The mother
plaits their black hair on the crown of the head, partly to keep
it out of their face, and partly for ornament.&nbsp; This <a
name="page3_65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>is all she
ever does towards decorating her offspring; for in summer the
children wear no clothes till ten years of age, and in winter
they are forced to be content with a few old rags hung about
them.</p>
<p>No sooner is the child, whether boy or girl, capable of
running about, than it is taught to dance; which talent consists
in jumping on one foot, and constantly striking behind with the
other.&nbsp; As the young Gipsey grows up, all kinds of postures
are added, in hopes of diverting, and thereby to obtain a reward
from persons who happen to pass the parents&rsquo;
habitation.&nbsp; What the children are further taught,
especially by their mothers, is the art of stealing, which they
often put in practice, as before related.&nbsp; Instruction or
school is never thought of; nor do they learn any business,
except perhaps to blow the fire when the father forges, or to
assist in goldwashing.</p>
<p>By the twelfth or thirteenth year, a boy acquires some
knowledge of his father&rsquo;s trade; and then becomes
emancipated from parental authority; as he now begins to think of
forming his own separate connections.&nbsp; The Gipseys, in
common with uncivilised people, entertain unbounded love for
their children: this is a source of the most unpardonable
neglect.&nbsp; Gipsey children never feel the rod; they fly into
the most violent passion, and at the same time hear nothing from
their parents but flattery and coaxing.&nbsp; In return, they
act, as is commonly <a name="page3_66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>the consequence of such education,
with the greatest ingratitude.&nbsp; This excessive fondness for
their children is, however, attended with one
advantage:&mdash;when they are indebted to any person, which is
frequently the case in Hungary and Transylvania, the creditor
seizes a child, and by that means obtains a settlement of his
demand; as the Gipsey will immediately exert every method to
discharge the debt, and procure the release of his darling
offspring.</p>
<p>To the beforegoing account of Gipsey marriages, and education,
there are but few exceptions; comprised in a small proportion of
them who have fixed habitations.&nbsp; The character of people
being formed by the instruction they receive in their early
years, can it then be thought surprising that Gipseys should be
idlers, thieves, murderers, and incendiaries?&nbsp; Is it
probable, <i>that</i> man should become diligent, who has been
educated in laziness?&nbsp; Can it be expected those should leave
every person in possession of his own property, whose father and
mother have taught them to steal, from their earliest
infancy?&nbsp; Who can have a general idea of fair dealing, that
knows not right from wrong, nor has ever learned the distinction
between good and evil, virtue and vice?&nbsp; Punishments
inflicted on others, for their crimes, have no effect upon one
who is not sufficiently attentive to take warning by the examples
of strangers: and when, by his own experience, <a
name="page3_67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>he is
taught not to lay hands on the property of others, he is become
so hardened, that the milder punishments leave no lasting
impression; while the more severe ones, which reach the life,
cannot have any effect on him, and are, as before observed,
totally disregarded by his fellows.&nbsp; So long therefore as
the education of the Gipseys continues to be what it is, we
cannot hope that they should leave off their vile practices and
filthy habits.</p>

68</span>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>On their Sickness</i>, <i>Death</i>, <i>and
Burial</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have before had occasion to
mention the constant good health of these people; and it is fact,
that they do enjoy it more uninterruptedly, and perfectly, than
persons of the most regular habits, and who pay the greatest
attention to themselves.&nbsp; They get no cold nor defluxions,
from the inclemency of the air.&nbsp; They are not subject to
rashes; even poisons, or epidemical disorders, have no effect
upon them.&nbsp; Any prevailing sickness penetrates sooner into
ten habitations of civilised people, than it finds its way under
a Gipsey&rsquo;s tent, or into his hut.&nbsp; They are equally
liable to the small-pox and measles with other people, though
with infinitely less danger; and they are subject to a disorder
in the eyes, occasioned by the continual smoke and steam in their
huts, during the winter season: excepting these complaints, the
Gipseys, in general, experience little inconvenience till the
time comes that Nature demands her own back again, and entirely
destroys the machine.&nbsp; Though this be not always at a great
age, it is generally at an advanced period; it being very
uncommon for a Gipsey to die early in life, or during his
childhood.&nbsp; Their love of life is excessive; yet they hardly
ever take <a name="page3_69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>the advice of a physician, or use medicines, even in the
most dangerous maladies.&nbsp; They generally leave every thing
to nature, or good fortune: if they do <i>any</i> thing, it is,
to mix a little saffron in their soup, or bleed and scarify
themselves; having observed that their horses use bleeding, as a
remedy for disorders.&nbsp; When the sickness indicates danger,
and that the universal enemy to life is really in earnest, the
Gipsey breaks out into sighs and lamentations, on account of his
departure; till at last he gives up the ghost, in his usual place
of residence&mdash;under a tree, or in his tent.</p>
<p>The preparations for death are usually regulated according to
a person&rsquo;s religious principles; but the Gipsey, who
neither knows nor believes any thing concerning the immortality
of the soul, or of rewards and punishments beyond this life, for
the most part dies like a beast&mdash;ignorant of himself and his
Creator, as well as utterly incapable of forming any opinion
respecting a higher destination.</p>
<p>The Gipsey&rsquo;s decease is instantly succeeded by the most
frantic lamentations: parents, in particular, who have lost their
children, appear inconsolable.&nbsp; Little can be said of their
burials; only, that on those occasions the cries and bewailings
are redoubled, and become very violent.&nbsp; When the leader of
a horde dies, things are conducted more quietly.&nbsp; His own
people carry him, <a name="page3_70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>with great respect, to the grave, where each one appears
earnest and attentive; although at the same time employed in a
manner to excite laughter.</p>
<p>This is the mode of proceeding when a Gipsey dies a natural
death.&nbsp; But it often happens that he loses his life by
violent means&mdash;not by his own hands for self-murder and
infanticide are equally unheard of among them.&nbsp; No Gipsey
ever puts a period to his own existence on account of vexation,
anxiety, or despair; as, besides his unbounded love of life, care
or despair is totally unknown to him.</p>
<p>Even in the greatest distress, the Gipsey is never troubled
with low spirits; ever merry and blythe, he dies not till he
cannot help it: this often happens on the gallows, attended with
scenes ridiculous as the most ludicrous imagination could
invent.&nbsp; One man requested, as a particular act of grace,
that he might not be hanged with his face towards the high road;
saying, &ldquo;Many of his acquaintance passed that way, and he
should be very much ashamed to be seen by them hanging on a
gallows.&rdquo;&nbsp; At another time the relations of a Gipsey
who was leading to execution, perceiving, by the discourse and
gestures of the criminal, how unwillingly he advanced, not having
the least inclination to be hanged, addressed themselves to the
magistrates and officers of justice, with the following <a
name="page3_71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>wise
remonstrance: &ldquo;Gentlemen, pray do not compel a man to a
thing for which you see he has no desire nor
inclination.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such scenes happen at almost every
Gipsey execution, which are proofs that these people are quite
deficient in thought or consideration.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Political Regulations peculiar to the
Gipseys</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Gipseys first arrived in
Europe, they had leaders and chiefs, to conduct the various
tribes in their migrations.&nbsp; This was necessary, not only to
facilitate their progress through different countries and
quarters of the globe, but to unite their force if necessary, and
thereby enable them to make a more formidable resistance when
opposed: and likewise to carry any plan, they might have formed,
more readily into execution.&nbsp; We accordingly find, in old
books, mention made of knights, counts, dukes, and kings.&nbsp;
Krantz and Munster mention counts, and knights, in general terms,
among the Gipseys; other people give us the very names of these
dignified men: Crusius cites a duke <span
class="smcap">Michael</span>; Muratori a duke <span
class="smcap">Andreas</span>; and Aventinus records a king <span
class="smcap">Zindelo</span>: not to speak of inscriptions on
monuments, erected in different places, to the memories of duke
<span class="smcap">Panuel</span>, count <span
class="smcap">Johannis</span>; and a noble knight <span
class="smcap">Petrus</span>, in the fifteenth century.&nbsp; But
no comment is requisite to shew how improperly these appellations
were applied.&nbsp; Though the Gipsey chiefs might be gratified
with these titles, and their dependants probably esteemed them
people of rank, it was merely <a name="page3_73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>a ridiculous imitation of what they
had seen and admired among civilised people.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
the custom of having leaders and chiefs over them prevails to
this time, at least in Hungary and Transylvania; probably it may
also still exist in Turkey, and other countries where these
people live together in great numbers.</p>
<p>Their chiefs&mdash;or waywodes, as they proudly call
them&mdash;were formerly of two degrees in Hungary.&nbsp; Each
petty tribe had its own leader; beside which, there were four
superior waywodes, of their own caste, on both sides the Danube
and Teisse, whose usual residences were at Raab, Lewentz,
Szathmar, and Kaschau: to these the smaller waywodes were
accountable.&nbsp; It would appear extraordinary that any
well-regulated state should allow these people a distinct
establishment in the heart of the country, did not the Hungarian
writers assign a reason: viz. that in the commotions and
troubles, occasioned by the Turkish wars, in former centuries,
they were, by means of their waywodes, more easily summoned, when
occasion required, and rendered useful to the community.&nbsp;
But the Gipseys in Hungary and Transylvania were permitted to
choose, from their own people, only the small waywodes of each
tribe.&nbsp; The superior waywodes, to whom the Gipseys, in many
districts, were subject, have existed till within a few years;
but they were appointed by the court, and <a
name="page3_74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>always
selected from the Hungarian nobility.&nbsp; The appointment was
by no means despicable; as each Gipsey was bound to pay the
superintendent under whom his tribe was classed, a guilder
annually, of which one half was demanded at Easter, the other
half at Michaelmas.&nbsp; In order to render the levying this tax
more certain, the magistrates, in all towns, cities, and
villages, were ordered to be assisting to the collectors, where
necessary; to protect them also from any violence that might be
offered by the Gipseys.&nbsp; These superior waywodes are now no
longer appointed, except a single one in Transylvania, who has
authority over the goldwashers in those parts.&nbsp; But the
Gipseys still continue the custom, among themselves, of
dignifying certain persons, whom they make heads over them, and
call by the exalted Sclavonian title&mdash;waywode.&nbsp; To
choose their waywode, the Gipseys take the opportunity when a
great number of them are assembled in one place, commonly in the
open field.&nbsp; The elected person is lifted up three times,
amidst the loudest acclamations, and confirmed in his dignity by
presents; his wife undergoes the same ceremony.&nbsp; When this
solemnity is performed, they separate with great conceit,
imagining themselves people of more consequence than electors
returning from the choice of an emperor.&nbsp; Every one who is
of a family descended from a former waywode <a
name="page3_75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>is
eligible; but those who are best clothed, not very poor, of large
stature, and about the middle age, have generally the
preference.&nbsp; Understanding or wise conduct is of no
consideration: therefore it is easy to distinguish the waywode
from the multitude, by observing his size and clothing.&nbsp; The
particular distinguishing mark of dignity, is a large whip,
hanging over the shoulder.&nbsp; His outward deportment, his walk
and air, also plainly shew his head to be filled with notions of
authority.</p>
<p>It is uncertain how far the waywode&rsquo;s sway over his
subjects extends.&nbsp; A distinction must here be made, whether
the state gives him any power, and what he assumes or derives by
custom from his caste.&nbsp; It were ridiculous to suppose that
the state should, on any occasion, appoint this sort of
illustrious personage a judge.&nbsp; In Transylvania, indeed, the
magistrates do interfere with regard to the fellow whom this or
that horde has elected chief, and impose an obligation on him;
but it is only that he should be careful to prevent his nimble
subjects from absconding, when the time arrives for them to
discharge their annual tribute at the land-regent&rsquo;s
chamber.&nbsp; He has no right to interfere in disputes or
quarrels which the Gipseys have among themselves, or with other
people, further than to give notice of them to the regular courts
of the district where they happen to be.&nbsp; <a
name="page3_76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>In this
point of view, what Toppeltin and others after him assert, that
the waywodes have little or no power over their own people, is
perfectly correct: but if we attend to their actions, the affair
carries a very different appearance.&nbsp; Whenever a complaint
is made, that any of their people have been guilty of theft, the
waywode not only orders a general search to be made, in every
tent or hut, and returns the stolen goods to the owner, if they
can be found, but punishes the thief, in presence of the
complainant, with his whip.&nbsp; Certainly it is not by any
written contract that he acquires his right over the people, for
no such thing exists among them, but custom gives him this
judicial power.&nbsp; Moreover he does not punish the aggressor
from any regard to justice, but rather to quiet the plaintiff,
and at the same time to make his people more wary in their
thefts, as well as more dextrous in concealing their
plunder.&nbsp; These discoveries materially concern him, since by
every detection his income suffers; as the whole profit of his
office arises from his share of the articles that are
stolen.&nbsp; Every time a Gipsey brings in a booty, he is
obliged to give information to the arch-Gipsey of his successful
enterprise; and then render a just account of what and how much
he has stolen, in order that the proper division may be
made.&nbsp; In this proceeding the Gipsey considers himself bound
to give a fair and true detail; though in <a
name="page3_77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>every other
instance he does not hesitate to commit the grossest
perjury.&nbsp; We may therefore judge how precarious success is
likely to be, when a waywode is applied to for the recovery of
stolen goods.&nbsp; The Gipseys are cunning enough to hide what
they have pilfered, in such a manner, that out of a hundred
searches the complainer hardly once accomplishes his
desire.&nbsp; It does not at all forward the cause, that the
waywode knows who the thief is: his interest requires him to
dissemble.&nbsp; Thus, though he does not steal himself, the
Spanish proverb is a very true one: &ldquo;The Count and the
Gipsey are rogues alike.&rdquo;&nbsp; For which reason people
seldom apply to so suspicious a judge.&nbsp; If a thief is caught
in the fact, the owner takes his property, and gives the offender
his proper reward, or else delivers him over to the civil power
for correction.&nbsp; Here ensues a truly laughable scene: As
soon as the officer seizes on, and forces away the culprit, he is
surrounded by a swarm of Gipseys, who take unspeakable pains to
procure the release of the prisoner.&nbsp; They endeavour to
cajole him with kind words, desiring him to consider this, that,
and the other, or admonish him not to be so uncivil.&nbsp; When
it comes to the infliction of punishment, and the malefactor
receives a good number of lashes, well laid on, in the public
market-place, an universal lamentation commences among the vile
crew; each stretches <a name="page3_78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>his throat, to cry over the agony his
dear associate is constrained to suffer.&nbsp; This is oftener
the fate of the women than of the men; for, as the maintenance of
the family depends most upon them, they more frequently go out
for plunder.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>CHAPTER XI.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>On the Religion of the Gipseys</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> people did not bring any
particular religion with them from their native country, by
which, as the Jews, they could be distinguished among other
persons; but regulate themselves, in religious matters, according
to the country where they live.&nbsp; Being very inconstant in
their choice of residence, they are likewise so in respect to
religion.&nbsp; No Gipsey has an idea of submission to any fixed
profession of faith: it is as easy for him to change his religion
at every new village, as for another person to shift his
coat.&nbsp; They suffer themselves to be baptised in Christian
countries; among Mahometans to be circumcised.&nbsp; They are
Greeks with Greeks, Catholics with Catholics, and again profess
themselves to be Protestants, whenever they happen to reside
where protestantism prevails.</p>
<p>From this mutability, we may conceive what ideas they have,
and thence deduce their general opinions of religion.&nbsp; As
parents suffer their children to grow up without education or
instruction, and were reared in the same manner themselves, so
neither have any knowledge of God or morality.&nbsp; Few of them
will attend to any discourse <a name="page3_80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>on religion: they hear what is said
with indifference, nay rather with impatience and repugnance;
despising all remonstrance, believing nothing, they live without
the least solicitude concerning what shall become of them after
this life.&nbsp; An instance, quoted by Toppeltin, will fully
illustrate this matter: One of the more civilised Gipseys in
Transylvania took the resolution of sending his son to school:
leave being obtained from the government, the lad was admitted,
and was going on very well, under his teachers&rsquo;
hands.&nbsp; The child died; whereupon the relations applied to
the magistrates and clergy for permission to give the young man
Christian burial, he being a student at the time of his
death.&nbsp; On this occasion the priest asked, whether they
believed the deceased would rise again at the last
day?&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Strange idea</i>!&rdquo; they answered;
&ldquo;<i>to believe that a carcase</i>, <i>a lifeless
corpse</i>, <i>should be reanimated</i>, <i>and rise
again</i>!&mdash;<i>In our opinion</i>, <i>it would be no more
likely to happen to him</i>, <i>than to the horse we flayed a few
days ago</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such are the opinions of the greatest
part of these people with regard to religion; it naturally
follows, that their conduct should be conformable to such ideas
and conceptions.&nbsp; Every duty is neglected, no prayer ever
passes their lips: as little are they to be found in any assembly
of public worship; whence the Wallachian adage&mdash;<a
name="page3_81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>&ldquo;The
Gipsey&rsquo;s church was built with bacon, and the dogs ate
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The religious party from which a Gipsey
apostatises, as little loses a brother believer, as the one into
which he goes acquires one.&nbsp; He is neither Mahometan nor
Christian; for the doctrines of Mahomet and of Christ are alike
unknown or indifferent to him, producing no other effect than
that in Turkey his child is circumcised, and baptised in
Christendom.&nbsp; The Turks are so fully convinced of the little
sincerity the Gipseys entertain in regard to religion, that
although a Jew, by becoming a Mahometan, is freed from the
payment of the charadsch, the Gipseys are not, at least in the
neighbourhood of Constantinople.&nbsp; They are compelled to pay
this polltax even though their ancestors, for centuries back, had
been Mahometans; or though they should actually have been a
pilgrimage to Mecca: the privilege of wearing a white turban is
the only advantage their conversion gives them over unbelieving
Jews and Gipseys.</p>
<p>Such is the respect paid by the Gipseys to moral institutions,
in every country where they are found.&nbsp; It is true that in
this, as well as in other things, there may be exceptions, but
they are very rare; by much the greatest part of them are as
above described.&nbsp; Wherefore the more ancient, as well as the
more modern, writers <a name="page3_82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>agree, in positively denying that the
Gipseys have any religion; placing them even below the
heathens.&nbsp; This sentence cannot be contradicted; since, so
far from having a respect for religion, they are adverse to every
thing which in the least relates to it.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Their Language</i>, <i>Sciences</i>, <i>and
Arts</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span> that the Gipseys understand
and speak the language of the country where they live, they have
a general language of their own, in which they always converse
with each other.&nbsp; Writers differ in opinion concerning this
language, being undecided whether it be really that of any
country, and who are the people from whom it originates.&nbsp;
Some pronounce it a mere jargon, others say it is
gibberish.&nbsp; We can by no means agree with the supporters of
the first opinion, as the only ground for the assertion is
barely, that they do not know any other language correspondent to
that of the Gipseys.&nbsp; But they do not seem to have
considered how extravagant a surmise it is, to believe a whole
language an invention; that too of people rude, uncivilised, and
hundreds of miles distant from each other.&nbsp; This opinion is
too absurd to employ more time to controvert it.&nbsp; Neither
can the Gipsey language be admitted for gibberish; unless by
those who know nothing of the former, or are totally ignorant of
the latter, which is corrupt German; whereas the former has
neither German words, inflexions, nor the least affinity in
sound.&nbsp; No German, were he to listen <a
name="page3_84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>a whole day
to a Gipsey conversation, would comprehend a single
expression.&nbsp; A third party allow that the language of the
original Gipseys was really vernacular, and that of some country;
but assert it to be so disguised and falsified, partly by design
of the Gipseys themselves, partly by adventitious events, through
length of time, and the continual wandering of these people, that
it is entirely new formed, and now used by the Gipseys
only.&nbsp; This opinion contains much truth; but carries the
matter too far, in not allowing that any traces remain to prove
any particular dialect to be the Gipseys&rsquo; mother
tongue.&nbsp; Perhaps the great B&uuml;sching means the same
thing, when he says, &ldquo;the Gipsey language is a mixture of
corrupt words from the Wallachian, Sclavonian, Hungarian, and
other nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among these, the best-founded notion
may be, that it is the dialect of some particular country, though
no longer so pure as in the country whence it originated.&nbsp;
This opinion meets the greatest concurrence of the learned: and
will, we hope, be fully proved in another part of this book,
where the subject will be again discussed, more fully, in order
to corroborate the other proofs of the origin of this
people.&nbsp; It will then be certified, in what country this is
the native mother tongue.&nbsp; This is a point concerning which
most writers think differently.&nbsp; Sometimes the Gipseys are
Hebrews, then Nubians, <a name="page3_85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>Egyptians, Phrygians, Vandals,
Sclavonians, or, as opinions vary, perhaps some other nation.</p>
<p>It appears extraordinary, that the language of a people who
have lived for centuries among us, and has been matter of enquiry
almost ever since, should still remain an affair of so much
uncertainty.&nbsp; Gipseys are to be found every-where, and might
be very easily examined, as closely and often as any body
pleased, about their language.&nbsp; It would have been attended
with no great trouble, to have made so near an acquaintance as to
bring them to converse with variety of people, and thereby, by
means of comparison, to have attained some degree of
certainty.&nbsp; This observation sounds plausibly; but on a
closer examination the case is found to be very different.&nbsp;
First, it is not so easy as people may imagine, to gain much
information from the Gipseys concerning their language.&nbsp;
They are suspicious, apprehending an explanation might be
attended with danger to themselves; and are therefore not very
communicative.&nbsp; To this must be added, their natural levity,
and consequent seeming inattention to the questions put to
them.&nbsp; A writer, who had frequent experience of this
behaviour, expresses himself to the following effect:
&ldquo;Suppose any person had an inclination to learn the Gipsey
language, he would find it very difficult to accomplish his
purpose.&nbsp; Intercourse with <a name="page3_86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>these people is almost insufferable;
and very few of them have sense enough to teach any thing, or
even to give a proper answer to a question.&nbsp; If you ask
about a single word, they chatter a great many, which nobody can
understand.&nbsp; Others have equally failed of success, not
being able, by any means whatever, to obtain from them the
paternoster in their own language.&rdquo;&nbsp; Secondly, suppose
the language of the Gipseys had been perfectly understood soon
after their arrival in Europe, variety of opinions would
nevertheless have been maintained among the learned.&nbsp; It
would still have been necessary, in order to ascertain truth, to
have revised the original languages of all the inhabitants both
in and out of Europe, or at least a general sketch of them.&nbsp;
By such a review, the Gipseys&rsquo; mother tongue might easily
have been discovered.&nbsp; But many there are, as B&uuml;ttner,
Schl&ouml;zer, Gibelin, and Bachmeister, who have taken great
pains in the minute investigation of the languages, as well as
manners, of different people, and reckon those they have learned
by dozens.&nbsp; How was it, indeed, possible for the learned of
former centuries to be competent to the enquiry, as they had not
the aids which now so copiously occur to the historical
etymologist?&nbsp; Many dialects have been discovered, and our
knowledge of others greatly increased, within the last fifty or
sixty years.&nbsp; During that term, the <a
name="page3_87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>treasures
of the farthest north have been opened; and the most eastern
idioms become more familiar to us: we even know how the
Otaheitian expresses himself.&nbsp; All this information did not
exist before; knowledge in this science was much more confined
than at this period: nor was it possible for the most learned
man, so circumstanced, to point out the country in which the
Gipsey language was spoken.</p>
<p>The Gipseys have no writing, peculiar to them, in which to
express their language. <a name="citation87"></a><a
href="#footnote87" class="citation">[87]</a>&nbsp; Writing, or
reading, is, in general, a very uncommon accomplishment with any
of them; nor must either of these attainments be at all expected
among the wandering sort.&nbsp; Sciences and the refined arts are
never to be looked for amongst people whose manner of living and
education are so irregular.&nbsp; Twiss does, indeed, mention,
that the Spanish Gipseys have some knowledge of medicine and
surgery; but woe betide the person who confides in their
skill!&nbsp; It is absurd to suppose that they are possessed of
any secret for extinguishing fire: superstition formerly gave the
Jews credit for this art; in process of time, the Gipseys also
were believed to be gifted with it.&nbsp; Music is the only <a
name="page3_88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>science in
which the Gipseys participate, in any considerable degree: they
likewise compose, but it is after the manner of the eastern
people, extempore.&nbsp; In Wallachia, no other people possess
this talent; and, like the Italian <i>improvisatori</i>, they
always accompany their verses with singing and music.&nbsp; The
quality of the poetry of these ready composers may be
appreciated, when it is known that the rhyme is the part most
considered: to accomplish this, they are frequently guilty of the
most glaring solecisms in grammar; besides their ideas are
usually of the most obscene kind, and these expressed in the
gross style of rude unpolished people.&nbsp; It is not necessary,
therefore, to be a master, to hold their art in the greatest
contempt. <a name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"

89</span>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Character and Capacities of the
Gipseys</i>; <i>whether they are an Advantage or a Detriment to
States</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Imagine</span> a people of childish
thoughts, whose minds are filled with raw indigested conceptions,
guided more by sense than reason, and using understanding and
reflection only so far as they promote the gratification of any
particular appetite;&mdash;and you have a perfect sketch of the
general character of the Gipseys.</p>
<p>They are lively; uncommonly loquacious; fickle to an extreme,
consequently inconstant in their pursuits; faithless to every
body, even of their own caste; void of the least emotion of
gratitude, frequently returning benefits with the most insidious
malice.&nbsp; Fear makes them slavishly compliant <a
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a> when under subjection; but having
nothing to apprehend, like other timorous people, they are
cruel.&nbsp; A desire of revenge often causes them to take the <a
name="page3_90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>most
desperate resolutions.&nbsp; Thus they vowed no less than death
against a respectable German prince who died not many years ago,
because, on account of their misdeeds, he had persecuted and
driven them from his territories.&nbsp; They even went so far as
to offer a reward among themselves (probably something
considerable) to whoever would deliver him to them, either alive
or dead.&nbsp; Nor did they give up this insolent design, till
some of them, who talked too openly about it in the Darmstadt
dominions, were taken, and being delivered up to the parties
concerned, paid the forfeit of their lives for their good
intentions.</p>
<p>To such a degree of violence is their fury sometimes excited,
that a mother has been known, in the excess of passion, to take
her small infant by the feet, when no other instrument has
readily presented, and therewith strike the object of her
anger.&nbsp; They are so addicted to drinking, as to sacrifice
what is most necessary to them, that they may gratify their taste
for spirituous liquors.&nbsp; They have likewise, what one would
little expect, an enormous share of vanity, which is evidenced in
their fondness for fine clothes, and their gait and deportment
when dressed in them.&nbsp; It might be supposed that this pride
would have the good effect of rendering the Gipsey cautious not
to be guilty of such crimes as subject him to public shame: but
here his levity of character is rendered conspicuous, for <a
name="page3_91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>he never
looks either to the right or to the left in his transactions; and
though his conceit and pride are somewhat humbled during the time
of punishment, and while the consequent pain lasts, these being
over, he no longer remembers his disgrace, but entertains quite
as good an opinion of himself as before.&nbsp; The Gipseys are
loquacious and quarrelsome in the highest degree, though they
seldom make much noise in their huts, in which they generally
keep quiet enough: but in the public markets, and before
alehouses, where they are surrounded by a number of spectators,
they bawl, spit at each other&mdash;catch up sticks and cudgels,
vapour and brandish them over their heads&mdash;throw dust and
dirt&mdash;now run from each other, then back again, with furious
gestures and threats.&nbsp; The women scream, drag their husbands
by force from the scene of action; these break from them again,
and return to it: the children, too, howl piteously.&nbsp; After
a short time, without any person&rsquo;s interference, when they
have cried and made a noise till they are tired, and without
either party having received any personal injury, the affair
finishes itself, and they separate, with as much ostentation as
if they had performed the most heroic feats.</p>
<p><i>Thus</i> the Gipsey seeks honour! of which his ideas seldom
coincide with those of other people, and sometimes deviate
entirely from propriety: we may therefore assert, what all, who
have made observations <a name="page3_92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>on these people agree in, that honour
and shame are to them totally indifferent.&nbsp; We establish
this decision by comparing Gipsey notions with our own: trying
their dealings and conduct by this standard, they will often
appear ridiculous, frequently even infamous.</p>
<p>Nothing can exceed the unrestrained depravity of manners
existing among these people, particularly the softer sex.&nbsp;
Unchecked by any idea of shame, they give way to every
desire.&nbsp; The mother endeavours, by the most scandalous arts,
to train her daughter for an offering to sensuality; and the
latter is scarcely grown up, before she becomes the seducer of
others.&nbsp; Let the dance, formerly mentioned, be called to
mind; it will then be unnecessary to adduce fresh examples, of
which regard for decency will not permit a detail.</p>
<p>Their indolence has been already quoted.&nbsp; Laziness is so
natural to them, that were they to subsist by their own labour
only, they would hardly have bread for two of the seven days in
the week.&nbsp; This disposition increases their propensity to
stealing and cheating&mdash;the common attendants on
idleness.&nbsp; They seek and avail themselves of every
opportunity to satisfy their lawless desires.&nbsp; Thomasius
endeavours to propagate a notion, that this habit has grown upon
the latter Gipseys by degrees, in opposition to the practice of
those who first arrived, quoting Stumpf for his authority, who
talks <a name="page3_93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>of
Christian discipline and order among the original Gipseys; he
assures us, too, that they paid ready money for all they wanted;
but this testimony does not deserve attention: the Gipseys in
Stumpf&rsquo;s time were the same as they are at this day, nor
are they differently described by any of the old writers.</p>
<p>This is a lamentable enumeration of evil and ruinous
properties in the Gipsey&rsquo;s character, which applies not
only to a few individuals, but to by far the greatest number of
these people.&nbsp; Scarcely any virtue could exist in a soul so
replete with vices.&nbsp; What at first sight appears less
censurable, or perhaps even amiable, in them is, their habitual
content in their situation.&nbsp; They have no care about
futurity; they are unacquainted either with anxiety or
solicitude: and pass through every day lively and
satisfied.&nbsp; But this, in itself commendable resignation, is
as little to be accounted a virtue among the Gipseys as among the
Iroquois, and proceeds from the excessive levity of their
dispositions.</p>
<p>Let us now take a view of the natural qualities, and
capacities, of the Gipseys.&nbsp; Here they will appear to
advantage.&nbsp; Observe them at whatever employment you may,
there always appear sparks of genius.&nbsp; It is well known, and
no writer omits to remark, what artful curious devices they have
recourse to in perpetrating any cheat or robbery: but this is not
the only particular in which they shew <a
name="page3_94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>brains and
capacity.&nbsp; The following extract from an Hungarian author,
who was an attentive observer of these people, contains
corroborating instances:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Gipseys,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;have a
fertile imagination in their way, and are quick and ready at
expedients, so that in many serious doubtful cases they soon
recollect how to act, in order to extricate themselves.&nbsp; We
cannot, indeed, help wondering, when we attend to and consider
the skill they display in preparing and bringing their works to
perfection, which is the more necessary, from the scarcity of
proper tools and apparatus.&nbsp; They are very acute and cunning
in cheating or thieving: and when called to account, for any
fraud or robbery, fruitful in invention and persuasive in their
arguments to defend themselves.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Debrezin, as well as at other schools in Hungary and
Transylvania, there have been several lads admitted for
instruction.&nbsp; Cleverness is observable in all, with no
despicable talents for study.&nbsp; If another proof should be
wanting, let us advert to their skill in music.&nbsp; That no
Gipsey has ever signalised himself in literature,
notwithstanding, according to the foregoing accounts, many of
them have partaken of the instruction to be obtained at public
schools, is no contradiction to the point in question.&nbsp;
Their volatile disposition and unsteadiness will not allow them
to complete any thing <a name="page3_95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>which requires perseverance or
application.&nbsp; Frequently the bud perishes before it blows;
or if it proceed so far that fruit appears, it commonly falls off
and rots ere it attains maturity.&nbsp; In the midst of his
career of learning, the recollection of his origin seizes him; a
desire arises to return to, what he thinks, a more happy manner
of life; this solicitude increases; he gives up all at once,
turns back again, and consigns over his knowledge to
oblivion.&nbsp; Such is the reason why the Gipsey race has never
produced a learned man, nor ever will so long as these principles
are retained.</p>
<p>It appears certain that the Gipseys are not deficient in
capacity; and it seems equally decided that they have throughout
a wicked depraved turn of mind.&nbsp; Their skill and ingenuity
might render them very profitable subjects to the state, but
their disposition makes them the most useless pernicious
beings.&nbsp; They are not fit for agriculture, nor any other art
which requires industry; on the contrary, they are burthensome
from their begging, they do mischief by their various
impositions, besides, being thieves and robbers, they destroy the
security of a state.&nbsp; The goldwashers, in Transylvania and
the Banat, are the only considerable exceptions; these Gipseys
are considered the best of the caste; they have no intercourse
with those of their own nation, nor do they like to be called
Gipseys, but Br&auml;schen, and in the Hungarian language
<i>Aranyasz</i> <a name="page3_96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>(gold collectors).&nbsp; Their employment not being
profitable, they are generally poor and necessitous; yet seldom
beg, and it is still more rare for them to steal.&nbsp; Content
with their scanty subsistence, they sift gold sand in summer; in
winter they make trays and troughs, which they sell in an honest
way.&nbsp; These properties render them, not only harmless, but
serviceable to government; as they annually produce large sums,
which, but for them, would remain in the earth.&nbsp; What pity
it is, that so small a part should be well inclined, in
proportion to the multitude, in Transylvania and elsewhere, who
live in the manner above described!&nbsp; There remains perhaps
one more profession, in which a state might reap advantage from
the Gipseys, viz. that of a military life.&nbsp; This seems to be
doubted in Spain, as no Gipsey there, even were he so inclined,
can become a soldier.&nbsp; In other countries, people think
differently.&nbsp; For example, in the two Hungarian regiments,
the Orosaish and the Julaish, nearly every eighth man is a
Gipsey.&nbsp; In order to prevent either them or any other
persons from remembering their descent, it is ordered by
government, that as soon as a Gipsey joins the regiment, he is no
longer to be called by that appellation.&nbsp; Here he is placed,
promiscuously with other men; and by this wise regulation, may be
systematically rendered useful.&nbsp; But whether he would be
adequate to a soldier&rsquo;s station, unmixed <a
name="page3_97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>with
strangers, in the company of his equals only, is very
doubtful.&nbsp; His healthy robust body, active on every
occasion; at the same time so inured to hardship, that he can
defy hunger, thirst, heat, cold, and other inconveniences; makes
him extremely well qualified for a military life: on the other
hand, his innate properties seem incompatible with his
profession, and he has little of the essential requisite for a
serviceable soldier.&nbsp; How could a regiment composed of
people without heart or courage, who would be overcome with fear
and dismay on the least appearance of danger, who would give up
every thing, and only think of saving themselves by flight, ever
perform any great action?&nbsp; Or how could we expect, from
their levity, and unspeakable want of foresight, that they should
avail themselves to the utmost of any advantage with proper
precaution and judgment?&nbsp; The following incident, taken from
the Hungarian annals, may serve as proof, whether this suspicion
be or be not well founded.&mdash;In the year 1557, during the
troubles in Zapoly, the castle of Nagy Ida, in the county of
Abauywar, was in danger of being besieged and taken by the
imperial troops.&nbsp; Francis von Perenyi, who had the command,
being short of men, was obliged to have recourse to the Gipseys,
of whom he collected a thousand; these he furnished with proper
means of defence, and stationed them in the outworks, keeping his
own <a name="page3_98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>small compliment of men to garrison the citadel.&nbsp;
The Gipseys imagined that they should be perfectly free from
annoyance behind their entrenchments, and therefore went
courageously to their posts.&nbsp; Every thing was in order when
the enemy arrived, and the storm commenced.&nbsp; The Gipseys,
behind their fortifications, supported the attack with so much
more resolution than was expected, returning the enemy&rsquo;s
fire with such alacrity, that the assailants, little suspecting
who were the defendants, were actually retreating.&nbsp; They had
hardly quitted their ground, when the conquerors, elated with joy
on their victory, crept out of their holes, crying after them,
&ldquo;Go and be hanged, you rascals!&nbsp; Thank God we had no
more powder and shot, or we would have played the very devil with
you!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What!&rdquo; replied the retiring
besiegers, as they turned about, and, to their great
astonishment, instead of regular troops, discovered a motley
Gipsey tribe, &ldquo;are you the heroes! is it so with
you!&rdquo; immediately wheeling about to the left, sword in
hand, they drove the black crew back to their works, forced their
way after, and in a few minutes totally subdued them.&nbsp; Thus
the affair ended.&nbsp; In this manner Gipseys would frequently
trifle away by heedlessness, what they might have secured by good
fortune and alacrity, if they were permitted to act in separate
corps.</p>
<p>There are many instances recorded in the annals <a
name="page3_89a"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89a</span>of former
centuries, <a name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a"
class="citation">[89a]</a> of Gipseys having been employed in
military expeditions: but seldom, or rather never, were they
thought of as solders.&nbsp; At Crupa, 1565, they prepared cannon
balls for the Turks: still earlier, in 1496, they served Bishop
Sigismund at F&uuml;nfkirchen in the same manner.&nbsp; In the
thirty-years war, the Swedes likewise had a body of Gipseys in
their army.&nbsp; And when, in 1686, Hamburgh was besieged by the
Danes, there were three companies of them in the Danish
army.&nbsp; Their destination was not so much to stand to their
arms, as to perform other services; they were chiefly employed in
flying parties, to burn, plunder, or lay waste, the enemy&rsquo;s
country.&nbsp; As these are the operations most suitable to their
genius, they are now by the Turks destined to such purposes, and
incorporated with the Sains Serdenjesti, and Nephers.</p>
<p>Such is the assistance which has hitherto been derived from
the Gipseys in war; whence we experience the possibility of their
being rendered serviceable, although the strict watch necessary
to be kept over them, on account of their propensity to be guilty
of excesses and irregularities, would be exceedingly
troublesome.</p>
<p>But, in order to bring the advantages and disadvantages
attending them to a fair discussion, it must not be forgotten,
that at the very time one part of these people might be rendered
beneficial, <a name="page3_90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>viz. in time of war, another part would have it in their
power to do more mischief; by reason of the disorder which then
prevails, when the relaxed attention of the magistrates makes
them more daring in their depredations.&nbsp; Besides, what is
still worse, they are very convenient for the enemy to use as
machines for treachery.&nbsp; What they were in former times
accustomed to practise very commonly, they still continue
whenever they have an opportunity.&nbsp; They have been generally
decried, in early ages, as traitors and spies: perhaps this
accusation may be too far extended, but it is not without
foundation.&nbsp; A Gipsey possesses all the properties required
to render him a fit agent to be employed in traitorous
undertakings.&nbsp; Being necessitous, he is easily corrupted;
and his misconceived ambition and pride persuade him that he thus
becomes a person of consequence: he is at the same time too
inconsiderate to reflect on danger; and, artful to the greatest
degree, works his way under the most difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>This accusation may be proved by more than one
instance.&mdash;Count Eberhard, of Wirtemberg, with a train of
forty people, made a pilgrimage to Palestine in the year 1468:
and, as Crusius says, fell into the hands of the Sultan of Egypt,
through the treachery of the Gipseys.&nbsp; Further, during the
troubles excited by John Zapolya, in Hungary, in the sixteenth
century, sundry spies and delegated incendiaries <a
name="page3_91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>were taken,
which proved to be Gipseys.&nbsp; In 1602 Count Basta, the
imperial general, who besieged the city of Bistritz in
Transylvania, when he wanted to circulate a letter among the
besieged, effected it by means of a Gipsey.</p>
<p>They have been sometimes still more dangerous to a country, by
harbouring other spies, who, under the disguise of Gipseys, made
excursions, surveying cities and countries, without being
noticed.&nbsp; An example of this kind is recited in the
Adventures of a certain French engineer, Peter Durois; which is a
circumstance, in the records of Louis XIV. perhaps as much
unknown as it is remarkable.&nbsp; It relates, that at Padock
(Patak), in Upper Hungary, a great fire happened, through the
carelessness of the Gipseys; by which not only the little city
adjoining the fort was burnt, but the beautiful Bruderhoff was
also reduced to ashes: on which occasion seven supposed Gipseys
were taken into custody, one of whom was the French engineer
above mentioned.&nbsp; This person had travelled about with them
during nine years: he had sketches of all the principal
fortifications in the whole Roman empire, and the imperial
hereditary dominions, taken in the most concise manner, with
remarks where each place was least defensible.&mdash;This affair
has still another voucher, who says, &ldquo;in the month of June
of the year 1676, the Gipseys fired this little city (Patak),
together with the church.&nbsp; <a name="page3_92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>With these Gipseys was found a French
engineer, named Peter Durois, who had been nine years in this
disguise, and received considerable remittances from
France.&nbsp; He was taken by the imperialists, and there were
found upon him plans of almost all the cities of Upper Hungary,
and the German empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus these people, in whatever point of view they are
considered, are found to cause incalculable damage and mischief,
without, in general, returning the smallest profit or benefit to
the state in which they reside.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Concerning the Toleration of the Gipseys by
the different States of Europe</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the inherent bad and
pernicious qualities of the Gipseys, the question arises, What a
government can do with them?&nbsp; The evil they occasion has
long been a subject of serious consideration, and various means
of security have been devised.&nbsp; As banishment was a mode
punishing formerly often resorted to, nothing could be more
natural than that it should likewise be exercised against the
Gipseys.&nbsp; The clergy and politicians inveighed strongly
against the toleration of these people; and their exile was
actually resolved upon in most countries of Europe.</p>
<p>About the end of the fifteenth century, their persecution
commenced in Spain.&nbsp; King Ferdinand, who esteemed it a good
work to expatriate useful and profitable subjects&mdash;Jews, and
even Moorish families&mdash;could much less be guilty of an
impropriety in laying hands on the mischievous progeny of the
Gipseys.&nbsp; The edict for their extermination was published in
the year 1492.&nbsp; But, instead of passing the boundaries, they
slunk into hiding-places, and shortly after appeared every-where
in as great numbers as before.&nbsp; The emperor Charles V. <a
name="page3_94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>persecuted
them afresh; as did Philip II. also.&nbsp; Since that time they
have nestled in again, and were left unmolested till about twenty
years ago, when they were threatened with another storm; but it
blew over, without taking effect.</p>
<p>In France, Francis I. passed an edict for their expulsion; and
at the assembly of the States of Orleans, in 1561, all governors
of cities received orders to drive them away with fire and
sword.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in process of time they had collected
again, and increased to such a degree, that in 1612 a new order
came out for their extermination.</p>
<p>In Italy, their situation has been equally precarious.&nbsp;
In the year 1572 they were compelled to retire from the
territories of Milan and Parma; and at a period somewhat earlier
they were chased beyond the Venetian jurisdiction.</p>
<p>England first endeavoured to disburthen itself of them in the
year 1531, under Henry VIII: but as the act passed for that
purpose fell into disregard, a new one was published in the reign
of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>They were not allowed the privilege of remaining unmolested in
Denmark, as the code of Danish laws specifies: &ldquo;The Tartars
(Gipseys) who wander about every-where, doing great damage to the
people, by their lies, thefts, and witchcraft, <a
name="page3_95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>shall be
taken into custody by every magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sweden has not been more favourable, having at three different
times attacked them.&nbsp; A very sharp order for their explusion
came out in the year 1662.&nbsp; The diet of 1723 published a
second: and that of 1727 repeated the foregoing, with additional
severity.</p>
<p>They were excluded from the Netherlands under pain of death,
partly by Charles V. and partly afterwards by the United
Provinces in 1582.</p>
<p>Finally, the greatest number of sentences of exile have been
pronounced against them in Germany.&nbsp; As well imperial
decrees, as those of particular princes, have been repeatedly
issued, for removing these people.&nbsp; The beginning was made,
under Maximilian I. at the Augsburgh diet in 1500; where the
following article was drawn up: &ldquo;Respecting those people
who call themselves Gipseys, roving up and down the
country&mdash;By public edict, to all ranks of the empire,
according to the obligations under which they are bound to Us and
the Holy Empire, it is strictly ordered, that in future they do
not permit the said Gipseys (since there is authentic evidence of
their being spies, scouts, and conveyers of intelligence,
betraying the Christians to the Turks) to pass or remain within
their territories, nor to trade or <a name="page3_96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>traffic; neither to grant them
protection nor convoy.&nbsp; And that the said Gipseys do
withdraw themselves, before Easter next ensuing, from the German
dominions, entirely quit them, nor suffer themselves to be found
therein: as in case they should transgress after that time, and
receive injury from any person, they shall have no redress, nor
shall such person be thought to have committed any
crime.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same business occupied the attention of
the diet in 1530, 1544&ndash;48&ndash;51; and was also again
enforced in the improved police regulation of Frankfort in
1577.</p>
<p>Several princes were however so little attentive to these
orders of the empire, that, instead of endeavouring to drive out
the Gipseys, they, on the other hand, furnished them with
passports and safe-conducts: others, on the contrary, and by far
the greatest number, exerted themselves to the utmost to clear
their states of this vermin, and some still continue the same
watchfulness.</p>
<p>Hence it appears how universally the opinion was adopted, that
banishing the Gipseys was the only method to be secure from their
malignity.&nbsp; Perhaps there is not one civilised state,
Hungary and Transylvania excepted, where this remedy has not been
tried: but whether it be as expedient as it has been hitherto
general, is much to be doubted.</p>
<p>In the first place, it had very little effect, and <a
name="page3_97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>that little
was only temporary.&nbsp; Even if every civilised nation had
driven out the Gipseys at the same time, Europe could not have
been entirely cleared of them, so long as they preserved an
asylum in Turkey.&nbsp; Now, as experience evinces there is no
country in which a constant equal attention is paid to the
execution of the laws, they would, in more or less time, have
again insinuated themselves into the neighbouring countries; from
these into others; and recommenced where they had left off.&nbsp;
But a general extermination never did happen: for the law for
banishing them passed in one state before it was thought of in
the next, or when a like order had long become obsolete and sunk
into oblivion.&nbsp; These desirable guests were, therefore,
merely compelled to shift their quarters to an adjoining state,
where they remained till the government began to clear them away;
upon which the fugitives either retired back whence they came, or
went on progressively to a third place, thus making a continual
revolution.</p>
<p>Secondly, this remedy was premature: endeavouring to
exterminate was the same as if a surgeon should proceed directly
to the amputation of a diseased limb, because it created
inconvenience to the rest of the body.&nbsp; Whereas the first
enquiry ought to be, Whether the disorder were of such a nature,
as not to be removed but by entire separation?&nbsp; This is a
desperate course, and should only <a name="page3_98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>be adopted when no other can be
efficacious.&nbsp; Though it be proved that the Gipseys had
occasioned ever so much mischief, it was not impossible that they
might cease to be such pernicious beings: at least there had
never been any trial made, by which this impossibility could be
ascertained.&nbsp; Men may be formed to any thing.&nbsp; Had
proper means been used for their civilisation, it is highly
probable the event would have proved that they were not incapable
of becoming better.&nbsp; If several Gipseys, at different times,
have voluntarily emerged from their savageness, how much more
likely is it that the remainder might have been altered, had they
received such aids as their necessities required?&mdash;But
expelling the Gipseys entirely was not merely a premature step;
it was,</p>
<p>Thirdly, a wasteful one.&nbsp; This may perhaps appear
strange, but is indisputable, so long as the state maxim holds
good&mdash;that a numerous population is the most
advantageous.&nbsp; It is allowed that a state would not lose any
thing by the Gipseys, as Gipseys; on the contrary, it would be a
gainer, because an obstacle to the general welfare would be
removed: but this is not the matter in question.&nbsp; If the
Gipsey do not know how to make use of the faculties with which
nature has endowed him; let the state teach him, and keep him in
leading-strings till the end is attained.&nbsp; And though the
root of this depravity lie so deep, <a name="page3_99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>that it cannot be removed in the
first generation, a continuation of the same care will, in the
second and third descent, be sure of meeting its reward.&nbsp;
Now let us reflect on a Gipsey when he has discontinued his
vagrant mode of living&mdash;consider him with his fecundity and
numerous family, who by being reformed are made useful
citizens&mdash;and we shall perceive how great a want of economy
it was to throw him away as dross.</p>
<p>Nearly the same idea has occurred to other authors; at least
they so far agree in what has been advanced, that they advise
rendering the Gipseys useful: only the means they recommend are
liable to powerful objections.&nbsp; They think the state might
make public slaves, or penitentiaries, of these people, and put
them to all kinds of work.&nbsp; But such dependants, even
supposing them to be employed in the most beneficial way, are
always a nuisance and burthen to a state.&nbsp; Besides, in the
above scheme, there is no proposal made for the bettering these
people: they must, therefore, remain under the restraint of
convicts, from generation to generation.&nbsp; And, if allowed to
increase, what could be done at last with this multitude and
their brood?&nbsp; Would not whole districts be required, merely
to turn the thousands of these wretches into?&nbsp; Moreover,
what an expense and inconvenience to superintend them!&nbsp;
Plausible, therefore, as that proposal <a
name="page3_100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>appears
at the first glance, little will it stand the test of a closer
examination.</p>
<p>Banishment was not the proper method to be adopted; nor would
it have been adviseable to make them penitentiaries or
galley-slaves: but care should have been taken to enlighten their
understandings, and to mend their hearts.</p>
<p>However, what has been hitherto omitted, there is still time
enough to execute.&nbsp; Few, or scarcely any, of the larger
states are so entirely cleared of Gipseys, that these people may
not here and there be found by hundreds, in most countries by
thousands.&nbsp; The periods when the first sentences of
banishment were pronounced, were too unphilosophical for any
preferable mode of punishment to be suggested: but it may be
expected, from a more informed age, that better maxims will be
adopted.&nbsp; We send apostles to the East and West, to the most
distant parts of the earth, and, as will be hereafter shewn, into
the very country whence the Gipseys migrated, in order to
instruct the people who know not God.&nbsp; Is it not
inconsistent for men to be solicitous for the welfare of their
fellow-creatures in distant regions, and to throw off and leave
to chance those who, equally wretched, have brought their errors
home to us?&nbsp; If it be a good work, to teach religion and
virtue to such as are ignorant of their Creator, why not begin
with those nearest to <a name="page3_101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>us? especially as neglect, in this
particular, is attended with detriment to society in
general.&nbsp; The Gipseys have been long enough among civilised
people, to prove that they will not be allured, by the mere
example of others, to free themselves from the fetters of old
customs and vices.&nbsp; In order to accomplish that end, foreign
and more effectual help is requisite.&nbsp; It were vain to hope
for any considerable progress with those who are grown up; it
would be sufficient, by compulsion, to make them quit their
unsettled manner of life, and, by instruction and teaching, to
convey a glimmering of light to their understanding, and produce
some amelioration of the heart.&nbsp; Proper care being taken of
the education of the children, society would be more likely to
have its endeavours crowned with success.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Essay on the Improvement of the
Gipseys</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would be a lamentable case, if
the before-mentioned regulations were merely pious wishes.&nbsp;
Let us hope something better!&nbsp; The work has been
commenced;&mdash;a great empress, Theresa, laid down a plan to
win over these poor unfortunate people to virtue and the
state.&nbsp; But it is to be regretted, that the execution of her
wise dispositions, respecting the Gipseys in Hungary, seems to
have been entrusted to people inadequate to the task.</p>
<p>What was done, in her time, towards the accomplishment of this
work, may be seen by the following article, extracted from the
Newspaper already often quoted, called <i>Anzeigen aus den
Kayserl</i>. <i>K&ouml;nigl</i>. <i>Erbl&auml;ndern</i>
(Intelligence from the Hereditary Imperial Royal Dominions):
&ldquo;Since the year 1768, several decrees regarding these
people have been published in the country (Hungary), and the
strictest orders dispatched to the several districts in
consequence.&nbsp; They were prohibited from dwelling in huts or
tents; from wandering up and down the country; from dealing in
horses; from eating animals which died naturally, and carrion;
and from electing their own wayda or <a
name="page3_103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>judge.&nbsp; It was intended to extirpate the very name
and language of these folks, out of the country.&nbsp; They were
no longer to be called Gipseys, but New Boors (Uj Magyar); not to
converse any longer with each other in their own language, but in
that of any of the countries in which they had chosen to
reside.&nbsp; Some months were to be allowed, after which time
they were to quit their Gipsey manner of life, and settle, like
the other inhabitants, in cities or villages; to build decent
houses, and follow some reputable business.&nbsp; They were to
procure boors&rsquo; clothing, to commit themselves to the
protection of some territorial superior, and live
regularly.&nbsp; Such as were fit for soldiers, to be enlisted
into regiments.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless, although these
regulations were calculated entirely for the good of these people
and the state, the greatest part were not in the smallest degree
benefited by them.&nbsp; The effect which was produced gave
occasion, in the year 1773, for these orders not only to be
repeated, but made more rigid; and as even this measure would not
answer the end, it was then thought necessary to proceed to
extremity with them.&nbsp; Wherefore it was ordered, That no
Gipsey should have permission to marry, who could not prove
himself in condition to support a wife and children: that from
such Gipseys who had families, the children should be taken away
by force, removed <a name="page3_104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>from their parents, relations, and
intercourse with the Gipsey race, to have a better education
given them.&nbsp; A beginning was made in some places; and where
they would not comply voluntarily, they were compelled to submit
to the decree.&nbsp; At Fahlendorf in Sch&uuml;tt, and in the
district of Pressburg, all the children of the New Boors
(Gipseys) above five years old, were carried away in waggons
during the night of the 21st of December, 1773, by overseers
appointed for that purpose; in order that, at a distance from
their parents or relations, they might be more usefully educated,
and become accustomed to work.&nbsp; Those boors who were willing
to receive and bring up these children, were paid eighteen
guilders yearly from government.&nbsp; On the 24th of April,
1774, between five and six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the
children of the Gipseys, which had been growing up from December
of the foregoing year, were again removed from Fahlendorf in
Sch&uuml;tt and Hideghid, for the purpose of being put under the
same course of discipline as the others.&nbsp; Among the children
taken away on this occasion, was a girl fourteen years old, who
was forced to submit to be carried off in her bridal state.&nbsp;
She tore her hair for grief and rage, and was quite beside
herself with agitation: but she recovered a composed state of
mind; and, in 1776, in Fasching, obtained permission to
accomplish her marriage.</p>
<p><a name="page3_105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>So
far our intelligence quoted from the Gazettes; by which we may
see how prudently every thing was concerted.&nbsp; It is true,
the means here used are compulsory; but such measures were
necessary, and the only ones capable of insuring success.&nbsp;
Moreover, it may at the same time be observed, although the
publisher of this information endeavours to conceal it, how
little these salutary regulations were put in force: there were
scarcely two places in the kingdom, where even an endeavour was
made to give them proper effect.&nbsp; This supineness must have
been unknown to the emperor Joseph, or he would certainly have
again enforced them, to all chiefs and governors, at the same
time that he gave orders for their being observed in
Transylvania.</p>
<p>The tenor of the decree just mentioned, which was published in
the year 1782, was consonant with the intention of Theresa with
regard to the Hungarian Gipseys, namely, that those also in
Transylvania should become better men, and more useful
inhabitants.&nbsp; For the accomplishment of which, it prohibits
their wandering about and living under tents; requires that they
become settled, and put themselves under some territorial
chief.&nbsp; In order to strike immediately at the root of the
evil, necessary and minute directions are given for the
improvement of their religious ideas <a
name="page3_106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>and
opinions, and, by correcting their vicious habits, for rendering
them good citizens.&nbsp; First, with respect to religion, they
must</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; Not only be taught the principles
of religion themselves, but send their children early to
school:</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; Prevent, as much as possible, their
children from running about naked, in the house, the roads, and
streets, thereby giving offense and disgust to other people:</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; In their dwellings, not permit
their children to sleep promiscuously by each other, without
distinction of sex:</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; Diligently attend at church,
particularly on Sundays and holidays, to give proof of their
Christian disposition:</p>
<p class="gutindent">5.&nbsp; Put themselves under the guidance
of spiritual teachers, and conduct themselves conformably to the
rules laid down by them.</p>
<p>Secondly, with regard to their temporal conduct and better
mode of living, they are bound</p>
<p class="gutindent">1.&nbsp; To conform to the custom of the
country, in diet, dress, and language: consequently to abstain
from feeding on cattle which have died of distempers; not to go
about in such unseemly dresses; and to discontinue <a
name="page3_107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>the use
of their own particular language:</p>
<p class="gutindent">2.&nbsp; Not to appear any more in large
cloaks, which are chiefly useful to hide things that have been
stolen.</p>
<p class="gutindent">3.&nbsp; No Gipsey, except he be a
goldwasher, shall keep a horse: also the goldwashers</p>
<p class="gutindent">4.&nbsp; Must refrain from all kinds of
bartering at the annual fairs.</p>
<p class="gutindent">5.&nbsp; The magistrates of every place must
be very attentive, that no Gipsey waste his time in idleness: but
at those seasons when they have no employment, either for
themselves or any landholder, recommend them to some other
person, with whom they shall be compelled to work for hire.</p>
<p class="gutindent">6.&nbsp; They are to be kept, particularly,
to agriculture; therefore</p>
<p class="gutindent">7.&nbsp; It is to be observed, where
possible, that every territorial lord who takes any Gipseys under
his jurisdiction, do allot them a certain piece of ground to
cultivate:</p>
<p class="gutindent">8.&nbsp; Whoever is remiss in his husbandry,
shall be liable to corporal punishment:</p>
<p class="gutindent">9.&nbsp; They shall only be permitted to
amuse themselves with music, or other things, when there is no
field work to be done.</p>
<p>Such were the regulations wisely adopted by the <a
name="page3_108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>emperor
Joseph, for the purpose of civilising, and rendering good and
profitable citizens, upwards of eighty thousand miserable
wretches, ignorant of God and virtue.&nbsp; It must be regretted
that similar measures have not been used in the other countries
of Europe, where these people still remain wandering in error,
and scarcely deserving to be considered as human beings.</p>

109</span>SECTION II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON THE ORIGIN OF THE GIPSEYS.</span></h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The first Appearance of Gipseys in
Europe</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> record is to be found, stating
in what year, or in what part of Europe, Gipseys made their first
appearance.&nbsp; But it is to be premised, what will afterwards
be investigated, that they did not originate in our quarter of
the globe; on the contrary, that they strayed hither, as oriental
strangers, either from Egypt, Asia Minor, or some other part: we
shall then examine, whether it be not possible, by means of what
is related in old writings concerning the first observance of
them in different countries, to follow the track so as to
ascertain where and when they first set foot on European
ground.</p>
<p>Mention is made of them in Germany so early as the year 1417,
when they appeared in the vicinity of the North Sea.&nbsp; A year
afterwards we find them also in Switzerland and the country of
the Grisons.&nbsp; In 1422 they likewise appeared in Italy.&nbsp;
<a name="page3_110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>It is
unknown what was the earliest period at which they were observed
in France and Spain: but their appearance in these countries must
have been of later date than in Germany, as is proved in respect
to France, by the name Bohemians, which they bear there.&nbsp; In
regard to Spain, Cordova, in order to contradict some surmises
about the Gipseys&rsquo; mother country, uses the argument, that
they were known in Germany prior to either Spain or Italy.&nbsp;
The French make the first mention of them in 1427, when they
straggled about Paris, having arrived there on the 17th day of
August in that year.</p>
<p>From what country did they come into Germany?&mdash;Muratori
thinks, from Italy: but how unfounded this opinion is, appears
clearly from their coming to that country after they had been in
Germany.&nbsp; The Bologna Chronicle ascertains the time when
Italy became acquainted with these people.&nbsp; The horde
therein mentioned, which arrived in that city on the 18th of
July, 1422, consisted of about a hundred men; whose
leader&rsquo;s, or (as they called him) duke&rsquo;s, name, was
Andreas.&nbsp; They travelled from Bologna to Forli, intending to
proceed to pay the Pope a visit at Rome.&nbsp; Muratori founds
his judgment on this chronicle, not knowing that Gipseys are
spoken of in the German prints five years earlier.</p>
<p>Still less true is what Majolus asserts, that they <a
name="page3_111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>came from
Spain, and first entered the German territories in the year 1492,
when they were driven out of Spain by Ferdinand the
Catholic.&nbsp; Hungary is certainly the country whence they came
into Germany.&nbsp; Not only the time confirms this conjecture,
as we find them in Hungary in 1417, the very same year in which
they were first observed in Germany, but Aventin expressly
mentions Hungary among the countries from which he supposes them
to come.</p>
<p>In this state our examination rests, in regard to whether they
came immediately into Germany, or first appeared stationary in
some other place.</p>
<p>That Poland should be the country which harboured the first
Gipseys, and that they spread thence into Wallachia,
Transylvania, and other countries, is a mere arbitrary
surmise.&nbsp; The writer (J. G. Eccard) who advances this
opinion, appeals to M&uuml;nster&rsquo;s intelligence, but that
does not contain a syllable in confirmation of it.&nbsp; Others,
with the greatest confidence, maintain that Wallachia and
Moldavia, where they also wandered about in 1417, are the places
in which they made their first appearance in Europe.&nbsp;
Cantemir, on the contrary, is very undecided, saying,
&ldquo;Whence, or at what time, this nation arrived in Moldavia,
neither do they know themselves nor is there any mention made in
our annual publications.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, the second opinion
seems to approach very near the <a name="page3_112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>truth, but does not point out the
particular province in which the Gipseys were first
observed;&mdash;Of what use would that be?&nbsp; But one
information, compared with other circumstances, is of so much
assistance here, that we may, without hesitation, pronounce
Turkey to be the country whence these eastern guests found their
way to us.&nbsp; This is probable&mdash;First, because Aventin
expressly makes Turkey their original place of rendezvous:
secondly, as this explains why the south-east parts of Europe are
most crowded with Gipseys, as before stated (vide p. 7).&nbsp; It
happened in Turkey, as in every other place through which they
passed, that many of these wanderers remained behind; now, as all
that came to Europe passed by this route, whether at once or in
different divisions, it was possible, indeed a necessary
consequence, that a greater number should continue here, than in
the different countries where their hordes were much divided and
diminished.</p>
<p>The time when they arrived, has been as little certified, as
the particular place where they landed.&nbsp; Perhaps, the
before-quoted chronicle of Bologna may afford some insight into
this matter.&nbsp; It relates, as appears by the context, from
the mouth of the leader of the horde which it describes, that
these people had been five years wandering about in the world,
previously to their arrival at Bologna.&nbsp; Now, if this
account is to be depended on, they <a name="page3_113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>cannot have arrived in Europe
earlier than the year 1417.&nbsp; But before attaching credit to
this relation, we are to consider, whether the author of it be
deserving of credit.&nbsp; To place any confidence in Gipsey
narrations, in general, would be very imprudent; as there are too
many proofs that their sayings are mere nonsense, and
contradictory prattle: but the case in question seems to be an
exception.&nbsp; All the inconsistency and falshoods which the
Gipseys reported, concerning whence they came, with the reasons
for their wandering, have an end in view.&nbsp; But with regard
to time, if they knew, they are more to be trusted, as no injury
could be expected to result from the knowledge of a mere
date.&nbsp; Now, the inference to be drawn is, that the leader of
a horde might not only know how long he had retired from Egypt,
or Asia Minor, and travelled about in Europe, as the time had
been short; but it may also be supposed, that he said what he
knew.&nbsp; In the mean time, we will compare this cited term, of
five years, with other circumstances, and see whether they make
for or against our argument.&nbsp; The first enquiry would be,
Whether there are any earlier authentic accounts of their
appearance in Europe, than 1417?&nbsp; But we do not find such
any-where. <a name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113"
class="citation">[113]</a>&nbsp; The second question <a
name="page3_114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>to be
decided is, Whether, if they were not seen towards the Black Sea
before 1417, they could in one year&rsquo;s time have reached the
North Sea?&nbsp; This doubt requires little consideration.&nbsp;
A year was quite sufficient for people like the Gipseys, who
never tarried long in a place, to have migrated even far beyond
where they were found.&nbsp; Again, if they were not in Moldavia
and Wallachia earlier than the year 1417, and yet appeared during
the same year in the neighbourhood of the North Sea, what great
difference would it make if they came from a province next beyond
Moldavia or Wallachia, travelling a few miles further to arrive
at the same place?&nbsp; It is therefore very credible that 1417
was the period of their arrival.</p>
<p>Although, immediately after their coming into Germany, they
spread so rapidly, that in 1418 their names were recorded in the
annual publications of almost every part of the country, yet
particular places seem to have been favoured by them.&nbsp; Thus,
in Bavaria they were not noticed till 1433; and they must have
very quickly withdrawn <a name="page3_115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>themselves from these parts, as six
years afterwards it was remarked, as somewhat new and
extraordinary, that in this year (1439) the Gipseys, a pack of
scoundrels, a vagrant gang, were come into that country, with
their king, whose name was Zundl.</p>
<p>They did not travel together, but in different hordes, each
having its leader, sometimes called count: at other times their
leaders were dignified with the titles of dukes or kings of
Lesser Egypt.&nbsp; One horde which arrived at Augsburgh in 1419,
although it consisted of only seventy men, had even two of these
dukes, beside some counts, with them.&nbsp; But what sort of
creatures these great men among the Gipseys were, has been
explained in another place.&nbsp; (Vide p. 72, <i>&amp;
seq.</i>)</p>
<p>If Stumpf be right, the number of these people must have been
very considerable.&nbsp; Those alone who came into Switzerland in
1718, women and children included, were estimated at 14000.&nbsp;
But here he, or his authority, seems to have greatly
miscounted.&nbsp; It is true, that he likewise remarks, they did
not keep all together, but went about in separate parties;
notwithstanding this, his account is much to be doubted.&nbsp; By
what is to be found concerning particular hordes, there were none
which exceeded one or at most two hundred.&nbsp; That which went
to Augsburgh in 1419 consisted of but seventy men: therefore if
they had been <a name="page3_116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>so numerous as Stumpf asserts, there must have been at
least a hundred such hordes dispersed through Switzerland.&nbsp;
It was at this time (1418) that Gipseys were first seen at
Zurich; they were a swarm, whose leader&rsquo;s name was
Michael.&nbsp; Four years had elapsed before they were known at
Basil&mdash;part of the very horde of this Michael.&nbsp; Would
not some other tribe have got to Basil before these, if they had
been so numerous?&nbsp; Thomasius adopts this number of 14000
without suspicion, and understands it to comprehend the whole
multitude all over Germany; but then he does not appear to have
quoted Stumpf&rsquo;s testimony in the sense it was meant.&nbsp;
Many hordes of them must certainly have arrived, as they spread
every-where so prodigiously; but to persist in any nearer
investigation of their numbers, would be only useless
trouble.</p>
<p>Their possessions were, as at present, small, and their whole
arrangement singular; besides which, according to the Eastern
custom, they hung ragged clothes about them, instead of other
garments.&nbsp; Their leaders only were exceptions.&nbsp; Several
had horses, asses, or mules, with them, on which they loaded
their tents, and effects, with the whole family into the
bargain.&nbsp; They had also dogs in their train, with which
Kranz asserts they used illegally to destroy game: but probably
the dogs were kept not so much for that purpose, as to take fowls
and geese.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>On the Sanctity</i>, <i>Passports</i>,
<i>and Difference</i>, <i>of the former from the latter
Gipseys</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the first arrival of the Gipseys
in Europe, it was generally believed that they were Egyptians and
pilgrims, constrained to wander on account of religion.&nbsp;
This mistake originated from their own relation; but when
required to give a more circumstantial detail of the reasons for
their pilgrimage, they varied very much from each other.&nbsp;
Some of them declared that they were compelled to make this
emigration as an atonement for their forefathers having, for some
time, apostatised from the Christian faith: others asserted that
the king of Hungary had seized their country, and imposed on them
this penance of wandering.&nbsp; A third party represented that
God had signified to them the necessity of this pilgrimage, by an
universal sterility in their country.&nbsp; They supposed this
punishment to have been inflicted on account of sin committed by
their ancestors, in refusing to receive the infant Jesus, when
carried by his Mother and Joseph to Egypt, as an asylum from the
persecution of Herod.&nbsp; The term of their pilgrimage was to
be seven years.</p>
<p>No evidence is necessary to determine that these <a
name="page3_118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>were mere
fables; and it is astonishing that men should be found to adduce
long-winded proofs of the origin of these people, grounded on no
better authority than such idle tales.&nbsp; We have not now any
positive grounds remaining, to shew how these legends were
invented, or what gave rise to them; but the real truth seems to
be merely, that upon being asked whence they came, they answered
from Egypt; and there is no reason existing to deny their having
come from that country.&nbsp; Now priests, monks, or perhaps
other people, might wonder why they should quit a place to which
the holy family had fled for refuge, unless their forefathers had
been guilty of some transgression on that occasion; but, be this
as it may, all that could be said, with regard to the origin of
their legends, would be only mere conjecture.&nbsp; Let it
therefore suffice to say, they chose to be considered everywhere
as pilgrims; and this profession met with the more ready belief,
as it coincided with the infatuation of the times.</p>
<p>The credulity with which people cherished the idea that the
Gipseys were real pilgrims and holy persons was attended with the
consequence, that they were not only tolerated, but, if the
information on this head may be relied on, they everywhere
received assistance, with express safe-conducts.&nbsp; These
safe-conducts are mentioned in several old writings.&nbsp;
M&uuml;nster declares, not <a name="page3_119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>merely, in general terms, that they
carried about with them passports and seals from the Emperor
Sigismund and other princes, by means of which they had free
passage through different countries and cities, but that he had
himself seen an attested copy of such a letter, in the possession
of some Gipseys at Eberbach.&nbsp; Besides Kranz, Stumpf, and
Guler, Laurentius Palmirenus also agrees in this statement; but
the latter writer is guilty of a mistake, in confounding the
Emperor Sigismund with Sigismund king of Poland.&nbsp; The
Gipseys at Bologna, likewise, shewed an instrument from
Sigismund; but he appears to have granted this to them, not as
emperor, and in Germany, but in Hungary, and as king of
Hungary.&nbsp; A pass of another king of Hungary, Uladislaus II.
which the Gipseys obtained chiefly on account of their supposed
sanctity and pilgrimage, might be quoted.&nbsp; They were not
destitute in Transylvania, if it be true, as asserted, that they
received this sort of letters of protection from the princes of
the house of Bathory.&nbsp; Wehner says, that the Gipseys in
France likewise quoted ancient privileges, granted to them by the
former kings of that country.&nbsp; Crusius, Wurstisen, and
Guler, mention papal permissions, which these people acquired,
for wandering, unmolested, through all Christian countries, so
long as the time of their pilgrimage lasted.</p>
<p><a name="page3_120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>This is the information we find, dispersed here and
there, concerning the privileges and passes of the Gipseys.&nbsp;
To how much, or how little, are we to give credit?&nbsp;
Thomasius believes every thing as it stands.&nbsp; Ahasuerus
Fritsch, on the contrary, declares all to be lies, and the
Gipseys&rsquo; own invention.&nbsp; Appearances are certainly
equivocal, as none of these instruments are even verbally handed
down to us, so that they can be properly proved; except that of
Uladislaus II. which does not belong to this question.&nbsp;
Moreover, it has been frequently experienced, that the Gipseys,
using the pretence of such safe-conducts, have committed all
manner of excesses, and when desired to produce them, had either
nothing to shew, or such kind of papers as did not at all
resemble what are usually given from a public office.&nbsp; It
cannot be denied that they have practised deceit, but it is
impossible to assert, with certainty, that the whole was
fallacy.&nbsp; If the contents of that passport to be found in
Muratori is conceived in such terms as to allow the horde which
possessed it to wander about seven years, to rob and steal
every-where, without any person being permitted to bring them to
justice, such a letter seems to carry falshood on the very face
of it, as no sensible prince could ever grant such a one.&nbsp;
But what shall we say, if it be found that these words do not so
much convey the sense of the <a name="page3_121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>instrument, as a crafty explanation
of the author, on recollecting the many irregularities practised
by the Gipseys, who availed themselves of this freedom to travel
about every-where unmolested.&nbsp; Further, with respect to the
passport which M&uuml;nster perused at Eberbach, although every
person must look upon the reasons given by the Gipseys for their
emigration as fictions, yet we cannot entirely reject it.&nbsp;
How could it benefit them, being old and having lost its validity
many years ago?&nbsp; Why did not the horde to which it belonged
carry with them some writing that might afford them present
protection?&nbsp; If they had been guilty of any knavery about
this letter, why was it just of that kind as could only serve,
incontrovertibly, to prove they were cheats?&nbsp; These
documents would certainly not have been found among them, had
they not been transmitted, from their parents and ancestors, as
things of value.&nbsp; Supposing this matter to have been
invented by themselves, it is difficult to conceive why they
should confine their privileges to seven years, and not rather
leave them unlimited.&nbsp; But there are other proofs of the
authenticity of such letters.&nbsp; First, they were looked upon
as pilgrims; and it was quite conformable to the custom of those
superstitious times to grant to pilgrims, as holy people, all
sorts of passes, and safe-conducts.&nbsp; Secondly, we must
believe that this did happen with the Gipseys, when <a
name="page3_132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>we read
with what chagrin Aventin mentions their thefts and excesses,
concluding thus: &ldquo;Robbing and stealing are prohibited to
others, under pain of hanging or beheading, but these people have
licence for them.&rdquo;&nbsp; When, thirdly, in the decree of
the diet at Augsburgh anno 1500, all ranks of people in the
empire are strictly enjoined, in future, not to permit the people
called Gipseys to travel through their countries and districts,
nor to grant them any further &lsquo;protection and
convoy,&rsquo; it certainly implies that people had formerly
granted them such protection and convoy.&nbsp; Whoever has still
any doubts remaining, may read, fourthly, in a decree of the
empire of fifty years later date, a regular complaint preferred
on account of the passports granted by various princes to the
Gipseys, and which are, by that diet, declared to be null and
void.&nbsp; All these circumstances together will not, it may be
presumed, allow the shadow of a doubt to remain, that such
letters of convoy have been really granted to the Gipseys. <a
name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132"
class="citation">[132]</a></p>
<p><a name="page3_133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>The
Gipseys&rsquo; golden age lasted a considerable time; but when
about half a century had elapsed, and people began to look at
them with a watchful eye, the old prejudices gave way.&nbsp; They
endeavoured to prolong the term, by asserting, that their return
home was prevented by soldiers stationed to intercept them, and
by wishing to have it believed that new parties of pilgrims were
to leave their country every year, otherwise their land would be
rendered totally barren.&nbsp; All this was of no avail; people
saw too clearly, that, instead of holy pilgrims, they were the
mere refuse of humanity: upon which followed the sentences of
banishment, we have before mentioned.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to other matters, it will be proper to say a
few words respecting an assertion in some writings, that the
latter Gipseys differ very widely from those who went about
during the first seven years, both with respect to their conduct
and descent.&nbsp; Stumpf, for instance, and others after him,
relate, that these first Gipseys were very orderly and decent,
did no harm to any one, but paid ready money for what they
consumed; for which purpose they received fresh remittances
constantly: and at the expiration of seven years they returned
home.&nbsp; Afterwards an idle desperate crew united, who, when
the Gipseys were withdrawn, took their place; and, by blackening
their faces, at the same time using the like outlandish garments,
endeavoured <a name="page3_134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>to persuade the world that they were the identical
Egyptians.</p>
<p>This is all related with so much appearance of veracity, that,
at the first view, no doubt would seem to remain of its truth;
wherefore Thomasius readily adopted the whole, and founded his
system about the Gipseys upon it: but upon closer examination, we
shall find that the statement is totally void of foundation.</p>
<p>This proceeding, we acknowledge, is recorded in four different
annual publications; but all the four amount to only a single
testimony, which rests entirely upon Stumpf, from whom the other
three have drawn their assertions.&nbsp; Let it remain, as
Thomasius will have it, an old manuscript account or chronicle;
it is still evident that the favourable description of the
ancient Gipseys originates from the same prejudice as first
produced their passports.&nbsp; And even these passports may have
contributed to recommend the first Gipseys.&nbsp; They have had
so much effect on Thomasius, that all the good he has given the
above-mentioned primitive Gipseys credit for, has been
principally owing to them.</p>
<p>When Stumpf, or rather his authority, mentions, with other
circumstances, that the earlier Gipseys received remittances from
time to time out of their own country, it was a necessary
addition, to support the editor&rsquo;s opinion: as the reader,
who was <a name="page3_135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>to believe that these people did not steal, but paid
money for every thing they wanted, would have been sceptical had
he not been informed beforehand where the money came from, in
order to provide for their necessities, in an honest way, during
the term of seven years.</p>
<p>With regard to the latter Gipseys, they were certainly lineal
descendants from the former: who were undoubtedly, equally with
these, thieves, cheats, and vagrants.&nbsp; The uprightness and
honesty falsely allowed to the Gipseys, in the manuscript
chronicle which Stumpf copied, might, even before Stumpf&rsquo;s
time, have induced the continuator of this chronicle to believe,
on finding his cotemporary Gipseys lived very differently from
what had been represented of their predecessors, that the former
were not the true Egyptians: he accordingly wrote down his
surmise, not by way of conjecture, but as positive truth, and
Stumpf, in his Annual Register, afterwards quoted it as
such.&nbsp; Whoever does not allow this, but considers the latter
Gipseys in the light that Stumpf represents them, must be ready
to answer, when called upon to solve, the following
doubt:&mdash;How was it possible that a collection of rascals
assembled in Europe, supposing that with respect to complexion
and clothing they should be able to transform themselves into
real Gipseys, could at once acquire foreign countenances, speak a
foreign language, and, both in <a name="page3_136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>constitution and turn of mind,
become perfectly oriental; and at the same time contract a taste
and desire for carrion, which remain with them to this day?&nbsp;
It cannot be denied but that some depraved people have associated
themselves with the Gipseys: but particular instances are not
proofs of general maxims.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Presumed Origin of the Gipseys</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would be equally useless,
prolix, and revolting, to reconsider the multitude of conjectures
which the questions&mdash;&ldquo;What race of people are the
Gipseys?&rdquo; and&mdash;&ldquo;Where are we to look for their
true mother country?&rdquo; have occasioned.&nbsp; The greatest
part of them are of such a nature, that they need only be heard
to be totally rejected.&nbsp; We shall nevertheless produce some
examples, as an excuse for passing over the rest in silence.</p>
<p>Various conjectures have been formed, and coincidences have
been searched for, to obtain a solution of these queries.&nbsp;
Some persons adverted to this or that name only of the Gipseys,
without attending to other circumstances.&nbsp; Because they were
likewise called Gipseys (<i>Cingani</i>), they must immediately
derive their origin from the Grecian heretics, called Athingans:
then again they must have wandered from the African province
formerly called Zeugitana. <a name="citation137"></a><a
href="#footnote137" class="citation">[137]</a>&nbsp; Another time
they are supposed to be the fugitives driven from the city
Singara, in Mesopotamia, by Julian the Apostate: others again
transplanted them to Mount Caucasus, and made <a
name="page3_138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>them
Zochori; or to the Palus M&aelig;otis, making them descendants
from the Ziches. <a name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a>&nbsp; Some people imagined that
instead of Zigeuner, they should be called Zigarener, which they
thought a corruption of Saracener, and they must certainly be
Saracens.&nbsp; Another writer (to return to Africa) conducts
them from the Mauritanian province Tingitane, and supposes them
to be the Canaanites, who, being driven out by Joshua, settled
here.&nbsp; Still another brings them from Mauritania, and, to
corroborate his opinion by the name, calls them descendants of
Chus; as he thinks nothing can have a greater affinity in sound,
than Zigeuner and Chusener.&nbsp; Herbelot judges the coast of
Zengebar to be their mother country.&nbsp; Bellonius, on the
contrary, looks for them in Bulgaria and Wallachia, where their
ancestors are said to have lived, under the name Sigynner.&nbsp;
Cordova stumbled on Zigere, formerly a city of Thrace, which he
assigns as their native soil.&nbsp; Some people fancied they had
heard that the Gipseys called themselves More, and often used the
name <i>amori</i> among one another (not <i>amori</i>, but
<i>Discha more</i>&mdash;Get out, fellow!) and now they are
Amorites!</p>
<p>Another party, besides this or that appellation <a
name="page3_139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>for the
Gipseys, considered their unsettled way of life, or selected some
particular circumstance from their manners, by which they decided
concerning their origin.&nbsp; Wherefore they were sometimes
torlaques, faquirs, or kalendars; <a name="citation139"></a><a
href="#footnote139" class="citation">[139]</a> sometimes the
remains of Attila&rsquo;s Huns, at other times the Avari, who
were vanquished by Charles the Great: then again Petschenegers,
who played their last stake in the twelfth century; or perhaps a
mixture of all kinds of rascally people gathered together, having
collectively no certain country, as their name <i>Zigeuner</i>
indicates, signifying, &lsquo;to wander up and
down;&rsquo;&mdash;for which reason, it is said, our German
ancestors denominated every strolling vagrant Zichegan.&nbsp; By
several writers they have been <a name="page3_140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>thought inhabitants of the Alps and
Pyren&eacute;es; others suppose them to be Cain&rsquo;s
descendants, who, on account of the curse denounced against their
stock, have been compelled to lead a wandering vagrant
life.&nbsp; Because they pretend to tell fortunes, some have
supposed them to be Chaldeans, or some Syrian religious
sect.&nbsp; Brod&aelig;us formed his judgment from their clothes,
in which he thought he discovered a resemblance to the Roman
toga; and thence he imagined they were natives of Wallachia,
descendants from the colony sent by Trajan into Dacia to keep
this newly-conquered country steady in its allegiance.&nbsp; And,
according to his assertion, people in Germany do really call them
<i>Wahlen</i> (he writes <i>Walachen</i>), that is to say,
<i>Italians</i>.</p>
<p>All these opinions are merely conjecture; it would therefore
be useless to proceed with the list of them: but it may be proper
to cite a few which seem to have a greater appearance of
probability.&nbsp; Let us begin with Wagenseil.&nbsp; He
considers the Gipseys to be German Jews; who about the middle of
the fourteenth century, to escape the dreadful persecution which
raged against them all over Europe, especially in Germany,
secreted themselves in forests, <a name="citation141"></a><a
href="#footnote141" class="citation">[141]</a> deserts, and
subterraneous caverns.&nbsp; <a name="page3_141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>In these hiding-places they remained
above half a century, not making their appearance again till the
period of the Hussites: as the Hussish heresy then engrossed the
public attention, with regard to the Jews all was safe.&nbsp; But
not daring to declare themselves, they fell on the device of
saying, that their respect for the Mosaic law would not permit
them to become Christians, at the same time styling themselves,
in general terms, Egyptian pilgrims.&nbsp; Those who did not yet
know what they were, nor whence they came, from their wandering
about (<i>einherzichen</i>) called them Gipseys
(<i>Zigeuner</i>).&nbsp; To establish this supposition respecting
the origin of the Gipseys, he refers to their <a
name="page3_142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>language,
which he says is a mixture of German and Hebrew, quoting, in
proof of his assertion, near fifty words, which are evidently
Hebrew.&nbsp; He then asks, Whence should the Gipseys have gotten
so many Hebrew words into their language, if they were not Jews;
at a time too when Hebrew was unknown to all other
nations?&mdash;This opinion bears infinitely more the appearance
of truth, than any one of those before cited.&nbsp; It must also
have been deemed incontrovertible by the learned author, as he
mentions it, in the introduction to his treatise, with great
confidence, and as much self-congratulation as if he had
discovered the philosopher&rsquo;s-stone.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
all this, the confutation is so short and easy, that very few
words are sufficient to overturn the whole system; which rests
entirely on the language:&mdash;the words quoted are taken from a
gibberish vocabulary; but gibberish is not the Gipsey language. .
. .&nbsp; What relates to the Jewish persecution is very just;
but all the rest are mere, and frequently inconsistent,
conjectures, founded on it by the learned writer.</p>
<p>A later opinion is, that the Gipseys are a horde of Tartars,
which separated from the multitude under Timur, when he invaded
western Asia, about the year 1401.&nbsp; The supposed proofs
are:&mdash;First, because the Mongols (Mongols and Tartars are
here reckoned one and the same people) are just as nomadic as the
Gipseys.&nbsp; Secondly, because these <a
name="page3_143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>have
sometimes declared themselves to be Tartars.&nbsp; Thirdly,
because the Gipsey king mentioned by Aventin, whose name was
Zundel or Zindelo, a Mongol chan, was a descendant from the great
Zingis: as Zindelo is a very easy change from Zingis.&nbsp;
Fourthly, because among the several states into which the Mongol
empire was divided after the death of Zingis, one was called
Dsongar, and the members of it Dsongari, which agrees perfectly
with Zingari.&nbsp; Fifthly, because the Tartar and Gipsey
languages have a great affinity to each other; for during a late
war between Russia and the Porte, a commander of Crim Tartars, by
name Devlet Gueray, signalised himself very much; and this Devlet
is perhaps derived from Devla, the Gipsey appellation for the
Deity, and may be a name under which the Tartars reverence any
thing respectable.&nbsp; Sixthly, and lastly, because the time of
Timur&rsquo;s expedition agrees very well with the first
appearance of the Gipseys.&mdash;This is an opinion founded on
six points; and one might add, in further conformation of it,
that this hypothesis will reasonably determine how the Gipseys,
such poor wretches in general, came to be so well stored with
gold and silver at their first arrival in Europe, as Stumpf and
others assert.&nbsp; If they were part of Timur&rsquo;s
followers, it was very likely to be plunder taken from the people
they had conquered.</p>
<p>Of all these grounds, that adduced from the <a
name="page3_144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>favourable concurrence of chronological events has the
most weight, but proves neither more nor less than the bare
possibility of the thing.&nbsp; With respect to the first point,
it is not so clearly established.&nbsp; The Tartars are herdsmen,
and the quality of the pasture for their cattle implies a fixed
residence.&nbsp; Gipseys, on the contrary, are ignorant as to
tending cattle, nor have they the smallest idea about breeding
them.&nbsp; Further, whether they are Tartars, because they
represent themselves as such, or have been declared such by other
people; whether Zindelo is a Mongol chan, because his name is
easily derived from Zingis; whether the language of the Tartars
bears a near affinity to that of the Gipseys, because a native of
Tartary was found whose name, Devlet, is perhaps derived from the
Gipsey word Devla, and as that word among the Gipseys signifies
God, it may possibly among the Tartars signify something like
it;&mdash;all this must be left to the reader&rsquo;s
discretion.&nbsp; If such assertions are admitted for proofs,
then the Gipseys must be Bohemians, because they are called so in
France.&nbsp; Thus Chiflet must have been of Gipsey or Tartar
descent, because his name may possibly be derived from Devla or
Devlet.&nbsp; The Franks, too, are probably derived from the
Trojans, because Pharamond, their king&rsquo;s name, may be
formed from Priamus.&nbsp; Dsongari and Zingari compared with
each other do coincide, except that the latter <a
name="page3_145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>is only
the Latin termination given by the learned.&nbsp; But, besides
all this, if the Gipseys must be Tartars at all events, where are
the Tartars&rsquo; broad faces?&mdash;Where is their
courage?&mdash;Where are the zealous religious principles with
which the Tartars honour the Deity, and, upon occasion, fight for
him?&nbsp; Finally, with regard to language, this contradicts
rather than supports the opinion we are discussing.&nbsp; The
language of the Tartars is Turkish; that of the Gipseys is quite
different, as will be hereafter proved.</p>
<p>As these and the like arguments rather controvert the Tartar
origin of the Gipseys, so can we as little agree with Mr. Pray,
in supposing them to be [Tartars] of Asia Minor, from the
Countries of the ancient Zichen, whose name the Gipseys are said
to bear; nor with an older writer, Ekhard, who contends that they
are Circassians, terrified from their habitations by
Timur&rsquo;s Mongols.&nbsp; Mr. Pray brings nothing further in
support of his surmise, than the similarity of sound in the names
Zigianer (Zichen or properly Zygier) and Zigeuner; together with
the circumstance, that the latter appeared among us soon after
Timur&rsquo;s expedition into Asia Minor.&nbsp; Ekhard, on the
contrary, who in like manner unites the names Zigeuner and
Circassier&mdash;by endeavouring to prove that these, as
possessors of the countries belonging to the Zichen, were by
authors indifferently styled Circassier, Zygier, and <a
name="page3_146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>Zichen&mdash;adds moreover, that the Circassian
complexion was a brown yellow, exactly like that of the Gipseys;
that they both suffer their hair to hang loose over the
shoulders; that in their diet and clothes they are both equally
dirty; and lastly, that among the Circassians, you meet with
astrology, and all kinds of witchcraft, precisely the same as
among the Gipseys.&nbsp; But this comparison, were it even better
founded than it is, would only prove that you may make what you
please of the Gipseys.&nbsp; Upon the same ground, they might
just as well be supposed to be allied to the people of Otaheite,
or any other uncivilised nation in any quarter of the
globe.&nbsp; And yet the author draws this conclusion from it,
that one egg is not more like another than the Circassian and the
Gipsey; and he may confidently assert, that all who before his
time have been of a different opinion, were mistaken.</p>
<p>We ought long ago to have spoken of the reputed Egyptian
descent of the Gipseys; but as that has been a very current, and
almost universally received, opinion, it merits a chapter by
itself.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>On the Egyptian Descent of the
Gipseys</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> belief that Gipseys are of
Egyptian origin, is parallel with the existence of these people
in Europe.&nbsp; It arose from the report circulated by the first
of them who arrived here that they were pilgrims from Egypt; and
this statement has not only been universally adopted by the
common people, but has also, here and there, obtained credit
among men of learning.&nbsp; Had this opinion not been received
at a time when every thing was taken upon trust without
examination; had it not been propagated every-where by the first
Gipseys, and obtained the sanction of time in following ages; it
would have been impossible for it to have gained such general
acceptation, or to have maintained itself even to the latest
times.</p>
<p>Till the seventeenth century, the Egyptian descent of the
Gipseys rested entirely on tradition.&nbsp; Thomasius was the
first who endeavoured to establish this matter on satisfactory
evidence.&nbsp; Those who, since him, have supported the same
opinion, are principally the Englishman Salmon; and, lately,
Signor Griselini.&nbsp; Before their vouchers are produced, it
will be proper to mention that <a name="page3_148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Thomasius speaks only of the Gipseys
who travelled about Europe during the first seven years after
their arrival; for he thinks that, after seven years were
elapsed, these, excepting a very few, returned home again, and
after their retreat the present set was produced, as has been
already described.&nbsp; In this particular, he differs entirely
from the other two writers, making the latter Gipseys a distinct
race of people from those who first arrived.&nbsp; On the
contrary, Salmon, as well as Griselini, consider the Gipseys that
are now wandering in Europe, and with truth, as lineal
descendants of the former, consequently bring them all from
Egypt.</p>
<p>Thomasius says: &ldquo;The first Gipseys never would allow
themselves to be any people but Egyptians; asserting always, that
the Lesser Egypt was their mother country: and they deserve
credit, as they were an honourable worthy set of
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; One observation will be sufficient in
reply:&mdash;Among the oldest writers who, prior to Stumpf,
mention the Gipseys, not one seems to be acquainted with their
worth.&nbsp; But Thomasius himself discovered the weakness of his
first argument, and therefore hastens to another.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be
this as it may,&rdquo; he proceeds, &ldquo;they were in the
earliest times, when doubtless something more certain was extant,
always looked upon as Egyptians: so that it does not become us,
who <a name="page3_149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>live two hundred years later, positively to reject what
was at that time generally assented to.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our author
was not aware that this kind of reasoning proves too much; for by
the same mode of arguing, every antiquated error, every
ridiculous superstition, may be defended.&nbsp; If this be
admitted, Satan gets his cloven foot again, of which modern
unbelief had bereft him.&nbsp; Thus, Christian Thomasius acted
unjustifiably when he laid violent hands on witches and
sorcerers, and put an end to their existence, though credited
from the highest antiquity.&nbsp; Thomasius imagines there were
other proofs, beside the Gipseys&rsquo; own assertions, that they
were Egyptians; this supposition, however, not only has nothing
to support it, but is openly contradicted by Aventin, Kranz, and
M&uuml;nster.&nbsp; It is not authenticated because the
chronicles universally mention it as a saying of the Gipseys,
whenever they speak of their coming from Egypt.&nbsp; It is
confuted by Aventin, who rejects their Egyptian descent; at the
same time he alledges, that they wished to be thought from that
country.&nbsp; In his time, nothing was known concerning them,
but what came from their own mouths: and those who thought them
Egyptians, rested their belief entirely on the veracity of their
informants.&nbsp; This is collected with greater certainty from
Kranz and M&uuml;nster; for these declare expressly, that every
thing which could be discovered, by any other <a
name="page3_150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>means
than their own assertions, contradicted rather than confirmed
their Egyptian descent.&nbsp; Yet Thomasius has more proofs; he
cites the resemblance between the Gipseys and the inhabitants of
the Lesser Egypt, whence they say they came.&nbsp; But many
people lay this difficulty in his way, that the name of Lesser
Egypt is not to be found in any system of geography, but is a
mere invention of the Gipseys.&nbsp; He rests his opinion on that
of Vulcanius, who looks upon Nubia to be the Lesser Egypt, and
thinks, for what reason does not appear, that the Nubians
themselves called their country by that name.&nbsp; These are the
similarities:&mdash;Nubians, as well as Gipseys, confess
themselves Christians; both lead a wandering life, and both are
of a dark brown complexion: to which some resemblances in shape
between the Gipseys and Egyptians are introduced in general
terms.&nbsp; Whether there be any affinity in their languages he
leaves undetermined, because, he says, he knows nothing about
it.&nbsp; That the name of Zigeuner is the same as Egyptian, and
the former is derived from the latter, he proves in the following
ingenious manner: &ldquo;The Spaniards&mdash;who, instead of
Egyptaner, call them Gitanos&mdash;have cut off the first
syllable.&nbsp; Our forefathers, who exceeded the Spaniards in
the art of mangling names, have rejected two syllables, and,
instead of Egyptianer, first called them Cianer, afterwards, in
order to fill <a name="page3_151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>up the chasm between <i>i</i> and <i>a</i>,
Ciganer.&nbsp; Further, as we, instead of Italianer, say
Italiener, we have also changed Ciganer into Cigener; and at
last, as people in Upper Germany are very fond of diphthongs,
Cigeuner, or Zigeuner, has been produced.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, if
any thing can be proved by all this, in the same manner the
several opinions quoted in the former chapter are likewise
established.&nbsp; And yet, after all, who will say, that,
instead of Egyptier, Egyptianer, whence Cianer, Ciganer, and thus
progressively through all the changes, Zigeuner may be
produced?&nbsp; With regard to the denomination of Lesser Egypt,
ranked under the list of Gipsey fables, and brought as evidence
to overset Thomasius&rsquo;s system, because Egypt never was
divided into Greater and Smaller, it is nevertheless a true
geographical name, though certainly not to be found in the
treatises on geography: it however appears in the title of a
Turkish emperor.&nbsp; A declaration of war, made by Achmet IV.
against John Casimir, king of Poland, in 1652, begins with the
following words: &ldquo;I sultan, a king and son of the Turkish
emperor, a soldier of the God of the Greeks and
Babylonians&mdash;<i>king of the Greater and Lesser
Egypt</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Gipseys have therefore, in this
instance, been falsely accused of a fiction: but whether by this
Lesser Egypt, Lower Egypt be understood, cannot be
determined.</p>
<p><a name="page3_152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Salmon believes the Gipseys to be Mamelukes, who were
obliged to quit Egypt in 1517, when the Turkish emperor conquered
this country, and thereby put an end to the Circassian
government.&nbsp; They are reputed to have acquired the name of
Zigeuner, or in the Turkish language Zinganies, from a Captain
Zinganeus, who was very active in opposing the Turks.&nbsp; How
all this is proved, will best appear from his own words:
&ldquo;They had no occasion for any testimony to shew they were
of Egyptian descent.&nbsp; The blackness of their skin clearly
indicated from what part they came.&nbsp; What confirms me, in my
belief of this intelligence, concerning the origin of the
Gipseys, is an act of Parliament, passed in the twenty-seventh
year of the reign of Henry VIII.&mdash;that is, fourteen years
after the victory obtained by Selim emperor of the Turks over
Egypt&mdash;in which are the following words: <i>Whereas certain
outlandish people</i>, <i>who do not profess any craft or
trade</i>, <i>whereby to maintain themselves</i>; <i>but go
about</i>, <i>in great numbers</i>, <i>from place to place</i>,
<i>using insidious underhand means to impose on his
Majesty&rsquo;s subjects</i>, <i>making them believe that they
understand the art of foretelling to men and women their good or
ill fortune</i>, <i>by looking in their hands</i>, <i>whereby
they frequently defraud people of their money</i>; <i>likewise
are guilty of thefts and highway robberies</i>: <i>it is hereby
ordered</i>, <i>that </i><a name="page3_153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span><i>the said vagrants</i>,
<i>commonly called Egyptians</i>, <i>in case they remain one
month in the kingdom</i>, <i>shall be proceeded against as
thieves and rascals</i>, <i>and on the importation of any such
Egyptian</i>, <i>he</i> (<i>the importer</i>) <i>shall
forfeit</i> 40<i>l.</i> . . . <i>for every
trespass</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then quotes another act, passed
during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, wherein the Gipseys are also
called Egyptians.</p>
<p>From the blackness of their skins, therefore, with the
official use of the name Egyptian, Salmon first draws the
inference that they were really Egyptians: then, because the
first decree published against the Gipseys in England was
fourteen years after Selim&rsquo;s conquest of Egypt, that they
were Mamelukes.&nbsp; There is not any connection to be
discovered in either conclusion.&nbsp; The Parliament used in the
act the word Egyptian, because it was universally current in
England.&nbsp; Whether the Gipseys were Egyptians or not, was a
question of learning, totally irrelevant with the intention of
the order; nor could it be determined by any juridical
decree.</p>
<p>There is still less reason for supposing them Mamelukes who
had travelled from Egypt on its being taken by Selim in 1517, and
tracing their name from one of their leaders: as both they and
their name were known in Europe at least a hundred years
preceding the fall of G&auml;wry; or before <a
name="page3_154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Tumanbai,
the latest hope of the Mamelukes, was hanged. <a
name="citation154"></a><a href="#footnote154"
class="citation">[154]</a></p>
<p>Griselini advances numerous reasons in support of his opinion,
and would certainly go a great way towards determining the
Egyptian origin of the Gipseys, if, as in most investigations,
more did not depend upon the quality than the number of the
proofs.&nbsp; Yet he does not suppose them to be genuine
Egyptians; and for this reason, because the greatest number of
those resemblances which he has sought between Egyptians and
Gipseys, intended <a name="page3_155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>to prove the latter descended from
the former, are not applicable to the question.&nbsp; Besides, he
finds himself under the necessity of looking for foreign helps;
and what he cannot make coincide with the Egyptians, he meets
with among the Ethiopians and Troglodytes: these he introduces
promiscuously, kneads the whole together, and determines the
Gipseys to be a mixture of Ethiopians, Egyptians, and
Troglodytes.&nbsp; This very circumstance, even before his
reasons are considered, <a name="page3_156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>renders the matter very
suspicious.&nbsp; By the same means, it would not be very
difficult to shew that the Italians are, in part, on account of
their nastiness, Ostiacks; in part, because of their
superstition, and admiration of magnificent edifices, Egyptians;
and lastly, in part, for their dastardly treacherous revenge,
Chinese.</p>
<p>Griselini begins his comparisons with the disposition of the
Gipseys.&nbsp; He says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They are inclined to melancholy, and are
desperate in the first emotions of their anger:&mdash;Ammianus
Marcellinus describes the Egyptians, of his time, in nearly the
same terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to religion,&rdquo; he proceeds, &ldquo;the
Gipseys of the Banat always conform to that which prevails in the
village, be it the Roman-catholic or the Illyrian Greek.&nbsp;
They have not the least comprehension of either; in which
ignorance they perfectly resemble the Wallachians&mdash;except
that they observe the strict fasts of the Greek church with more
exactness.&nbsp; The Wallachians separate from their wives only
during the last days of the great fasts: the Gipseys, on the
contrary, avoid their society from the beginning to the end; also
on the Ascension of the Blessed Virgin, in Advent, and especially
all vigils.&mdash;Apuleius, and other writers of antiquity, take
particular notice of the Egyptian fasts, whose <a
name="page3_157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>strictness consisted chiefly in this, that the man held
himself obliged to refrain from his consort&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, beside these solemn fasts, the Gipseys of the
Banat observe a degree of temperance, and a choice in their diet,
even on those days when all kinds of food are permitted.&nbsp;
They abstain from frogs and tortoises; wherein they accord with
the Wallachians, R&auml;izes, and other Christians of the Greek
church.&nbsp; Moreover, they refrain from some kinds of river
fish, viz. the red-scaled bream, perch, and lampreys; of which it
is known that, among the Egyptians, the race of Likopolis and
Tagaroriopolis refused to taste.&nbsp; The Gipseys are adverse to
all feathered game, and particularly to birds of prey.&nbsp; The
stork, when he deigns to build on their wretched huts, is highly
esteemed by them:&mdash;one of these birds, like its relation
ibis, was an object of worship, with other symbolical Egyptian
deities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of four-footed animals, the Gipseys are most fond of
swine&rsquo;s flesh, particularly salted.&mdash;The Egyptians
likewise consumed a great number of these creatures, though they
looked upon their herds and keepers to be unclean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gipseys hang up large onions in their dwellings,
but do not eat them.&mdash;Besides that the Egyptians honoured
them, as well as many other vegetables, we are informed by
Diodorus <a name="page3_158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>Siculus, that by the regulations relating to diet,
observed in the different Egyptian provinces, onions were
prohibited in some, but allowed in others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the old Egyptians, the Gipseys cannot bear the
smell of beans; although their neighbours, the Wallachians, eat
them with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was at Denta, in the district of Csakowa,
curiosity led me into a Gipsey hut.&nbsp; The first object which
arrested my attention was a young man covered with the itch,
whose mother was feeding him with the boiled flesh of a small
snake, on a dirty earthen plate.&mdash;In the same manner the
Egyptians used the flesh of snakes, as the mildest and most
effectual remedy for the elephantiasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well known that, even to this day, fowls and
others of the feathered tribe are hatched by art in
Egypt.&mdash;I must confess I was not a little surprised when, in
July, 1775, I went into a Gipsey hut before Karansebes, to find
an old woman engaged in hatching geese and ducks eggs, in
horse-dung.&nbsp; This was exactly the method of the old
Egyptians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From all which has hitherto been produced, as well as
that the Gipseys of the Banat, and others dispersed over the rest
of Europe, declare themselves to be from Egypt, it is highly
probable that they are of Egyptian origin.&nbsp; But see <a
name="page3_159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>a nearer
resemblance.&nbsp; So long ago as in &AElig;lian&rsquo;s time,
the Egyptians were famous for their patience in enduring all
kinds of torture; and would rather expire on the rack, than be
brought to confession; which is a striking trait in the character
of the Gipseys.&nbsp; When this equivocal means of learning the
truth, the torture, was practised in the imperial royal
hereditary dominions, several instances may be remembered of the
Gipseys suffering themselves to be torn to pieces sooner than
acknowledge crimes, even when the magistrates had the most
indisputable proofs of them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus far has been to prove the Egyptian descent of the
Gipseys.&nbsp; What follows is against it; and, from the
similarity of their condition, is to convince us that they are of
&AElig;thiopian and Troglodytish origin.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;According to the most authentic writers,
the Egyptians were solicitous to build themselves convenient
habitations.&nbsp; They lived decently; and their attention to
cleanliness, in the observance of certain rules of health, was so
general, that even the peasants, and the lowest classes of people
in the nation, were no exception to it.&mdash;The residences of
the Gipseys in the Banat present a very different picture. . .
.&nbsp; Miserable dwellings, consisting, partly of thorns and
straw packed together, and partly of holes, ten or <a
name="page3_160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>twelve
feet deep, dug in the earth.&nbsp; Taken in this point of view,
the Gipseys have more the appearance of being related to the
hordes of &AElig;thiopians and Troglodytes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the ancient Egyptians, agriculture was in high
esteem; as it still is among the present Copts, their true
descendants.&mdash;The Gipseys, on the contrary, are the worst,
and most careless farmers: another argument for their being
Ethiopians and Troglodytes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These and other African hordes, employ themselves in
collecting gold out of the river sand;&mdash;in like manner, the
Marosch, Nera, and other streams, have induced the Gipseys to
become goldwashers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An inclination for strolling, to which the Egyptians
were so very adverse, is the particular propensity of the Gipseys
in general; nor are those of the Banat exempt from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more artful, particularly of the other sex, go
about from house to house, where they tell fortunes, cast
nativities, discover thefts, and pretend they possess remedies,
to which they ascribe wonders and infallible cures.&nbsp; These
nostrums consist, chiefly, of roots, amulets, certain small
stones . . . mostly a kind of scori&aelig;.&mdash;Among the
Egyptians, likewise, such impostors rambled up and down.&nbsp;
These were Ethiopians by descent, who carried on a similar
trade.</p>
<p><a name="page3_161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;From the last considerations, compared with the
former, one would be inclined rather to deduce the origin of the
Gipseys from the Ethiopians and Troglodytes, than from the
Egyptians.&nbsp; But what I am going to add, will make it more
probable that they are a mixture of all the three nations. <a
name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well known that people of both sexes, calling
themselves Egyptian priests and priestesses, were, in ancient
times, scattered through Italy, Greece, and all the provinces of
the Roman empire: where they not only introduced the worship of
the goddess Isis, but wandered from place to place, begged, and
professed the same kinds of ingenuity in which the Gipseys of the
Banat, and the rest of their brethren dispersed over Europe, are
so thoroughly versed.&nbsp; These said priests and priestesses,
which Apuleius ironically calls <i>magn&aelig; religionis
sidera</i>, not only knocked at people&rsquo;s doors, in Rome,
with their sistris, but even had the skill to persuade the common
people, that to refuse them alms and to commit sacrilege were
equally heinous.&nbsp; They even went so far as to threaten those
who slighted them, in the name of their goddess Isis, to <a
name="page3_162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>strike
them with blindness, or the tympany (<i>hydrops
tympanites</i>).&mdash;Aventin says, the Gipseys could so terrify
the people in Bavaria, with the like threats, that they suffered
themselves to be robbed by them with impunity.&nbsp; Likewise in
the Banat, the women, particularly, are heard to vent the most
horrid curses and imprecations if they are reprimanded, or not
paid for their calculations of nativities, singing, or
fortune-telling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The licentiousness and immorality of the Gipseys are
extreme.&nbsp; In early youth, when yet young girls, they exhibit
themselves, with their dances, before every person from whom they
expect any present; and these dances always end in lascivious
attitudes and shameful gestures.&nbsp; In like manner, the
ordinary women in Egypt used to dance at their orgies, especially
at the feast of Bubostes, and the procession of Canopus.&nbsp;
The like scenes appeared at Rome, among the wives, daughters, and
sponsors of the priests of Isis, agreeably to the mysteries of
that goddess.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Griselini now comes to the point:&mdash;To what nation did
these priests and priestesses belong?&nbsp; And when did their
emigration happen?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was after the time of Augustus,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;that they began to wander through the different
parts of Europe; in every district of which, they endeavoured to
disseminate the worship of Isis.</p>
<p><a name="page3_163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>&ldquo;They practised astrology, and other kinds of
superstitious impositions, with all sorts of vagrants&rsquo;
tricks, in nearly the same manner as the Gipseys of our age
deceive people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it is known that the Egyptian priests had stated
incomes, from appropriated lands; which circumstance attached
them to their native country: and hence they hated an unsettled
life.&nbsp; Neither did they desire to make proselytes; and
strangers, who wished to be initiated into the rites and
mysteries of Isis, were obliged to submit to be
circumcised;&mdash;this ceremony was indispensable: on the
contrary, the before-mentioned priests of Isis wandering about
the Roman provinces, never mentioned a word of circumcision to
their new converts.&nbsp; Very sensible critics have produced
palpable evidence that they were Ethiopians and Troglodytes, who
could the more easily pass for Egyptians, as their features,
persons, customs, and religion, were the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the writers who mention these emigrations, from
Egypt, into Italy, Greece, and every part of the globe which was
known in the time of the Romans, I shall refer only to
Heliodorus.&nbsp; It was very possible that, sometimes, real
Egyptians who had been driven by misfortunes from their native
country, or perhaps some of the very lowest rank of people who
had nothing to lose, might be mixed with these wanderers.&nbsp;
<a name="page3_164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>From
this mixture of Ethiopians, Troglodytes, and Egyptians, then,
sprang a distinct wandering race, which partakes, in some
measure, of all the three nations; and from which, according to
the foregoing observations, we may reasonably conclude the
Gipseys of our time to be descended; as in all of them we
discover, sometimes the Troglodyte, sometimes the Ethiopian, and
sometimes the Egyptian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That no mention is made of them in the Hungarian yearly
publications before the year 1417, is by no means a proof that
they were not known long before, both in that kingdom and the
Banat.&nbsp; If we admit the Roman coins which are dug out of the
earth as proof that the Romans have been inhabitants of any
place, without the concurrent testimony of any historian; we are
equally authorised to admit the little Egyptian idols, of bronze,
which are dug up near them in the Banat, as proof for the
Gipseys.&nbsp; Being dispersed all over the Roman conquest, why
might they not as well, when Dacia became a province, have gone
there likewise, and propagated the worship of Isis, Anubis, and
other Egyptian deities, the same as in Italy?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such are Mr. Griselini&rsquo;s arguments, stated very
diffusely, as they may be found in his works: but it will be
evident, that what he adduces in support of his opinion, is a
direct proof that it <a name="page3_165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>cannot be established.&nbsp;
Supposing any person charitable enough to allow there is good
argument in his far-fetched similarities; yet the circumstance,
that neither in the Hungarian nor in any other Journals, is the
least notice taken of Gipseys before the year 1417, would overset
the whole again.&nbsp; Griselini felt this himself; but what he
urges in reply, is no answer to the objection.&nbsp; Nor is it
just, that the Roman coins found in the Banat should be esteemed,
without concurrent testimony, a proof of the Romans having
formerly dwelt there.&nbsp; German crowns are, as Mr. Niebuhr
informs us, the chief current coin in Yemen (Arabia Felix), and
great numbers are yearly sent thither for coffee.&nbsp; If some
centuries hence, when revolutions may have occasioned great
changes, the said German money should be dug up, would any
historical writer venture to assert as a truth, that Arabia Felix
had formerly been inhabited by Germans!&nbsp; But it is
unnecessary to enter into a laboured confutation of Mr.
Griselini&rsquo;s arguments; yet a few hints, with respect to his
mode of proceeding, strike so forcibly, that we cannot forbear to
notice them.</p>
<p>He relies chiefly upon certain similarities between the
Gipseys, Egyptians, and Ethiopians, without reflecting whether
they are distinctions peculiar to these people.&nbsp; Of this
description the following are examples:&mdash;he thinks the
Gipseys <a name="page3_166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>must be Troglodytes and Ethiopians, because they follow
the employment of goldwashing; these latter, as well as some of
the African hordes, do the same in their rivers which produce
gold: he makes them Egyptians, because they eat swine&rsquo;s
flesh: again, he concludes they must be priests of Isis, because
they exclaim against the hard-hearted, who refuse the boon they
ask.&nbsp; Are these, then, distinctions which none but Egyptians
and Ethiopians have in common with the Gipseys?&nbsp; Is it
necessary to recur to the Egyptians, to find people, beside
Gipseys, who eat pork?&mdash;Or to the priests of Isis, for
sturdy beggars?&nbsp; And, with regard to goldwashers, how came
he not to recollect that the Wallachians also follow this
employment?&mdash;And that near Strasburgh, beside other places,
hundreds of people who have not a drop of Gipsey blood in their
veins get their living by it?</p>
<p>Further, the said Mr. Griselini, in order to render his system
the more plausible, has made use of certain expedients at the
expense of truth; and, in spite of all experience to the
contrary, so modelled the properties of the Gipseys, as to give
them the appearance of complete Egyptians.&nbsp; He makes them by
nature inclined to melancholy; whereas their dispositions have
not the least tincture of it: they are described as most
conscientiously, nay rather superstitiously, attached to
religious customs; and yet, according to the <a
name="page3_167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>universal
testimony of other observers of these people, they are totally
indifferent as to every thing connected with religion.&nbsp; He
says, they are adverse to eating onions; and as for beans, they
abhor them: whereas Sulzer was a witness how much they liked the
flavour of both.&nbsp; By proceeding in this manner, every thing
may be made to answer all purposes.&nbsp; But woe to the records
and histories which are used in this manner!</p>
<p>It will be seen, from what has been said on the subject, that
the supposed Egyptian descent of the Gipseys is very far from
being proved; notwithstanding it was formerly so generally
credited, and even is to this day.&nbsp; Arguing on the
supposition that they originated from Egypt, care was taken to
inform us what kind of people they had been in that
country.&nbsp; It is very confidently related, and to our great
edification, that their forefathers were the same sorcerers who,
in the presence of Pharaoh, imitated Moses&rsquo;s miracles:
moreover, that the Egyptian king set these people as taskmasters
over the children of Israel, in order to render their labour the
more grievous: and finally, that these were the very murderers
employed by the inhuman Herod, to carry into effect his cruel
decree respecting the children of Bethlehem.&nbsp; This kind of
dreaming has been carried still further; it having been
calculated to what degree of indolence these people had
accustomed themselves <a name="page3_168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>in Egypt, living by the labour and
sweat of others.&nbsp; Afterwards, when, contrary to expectation,
the Children of Israel escaped from their servitude, the
lucrative employment of these overseers, of course, had an end:
instead of reconciling themselves to any kind of labour, they
rather chose to decamp, with goods, wives, and children, from
Egypt, in hopes, by cunning and fraud, to procure an easier
subsistence in foreign countries.&nbsp; They pursued this
shameful course of life through the following centuries; and
have, at last, pushed their excursions into our territories.</p>
<p>But it is not sufficient that the Egyptian descent of these
people is entirely destitute of proof; on the other side, the
most positive proof is to be found to contradict it.&nbsp; Their
language differs entirely from the Coptic; and their customs, as
Ahasuerus Fritsch has remarked, are diametrically opposite to the
Egyptian.&nbsp; To these facts must be added that weighty
circumstance, of their wandering about like strangers in Egypt,
where they form a distinct people; as not only Bellonius, but
many later writers assure us.&nbsp; Muratori, therefore, is not
in the wrong, when he thinks it ridiculous to account them
Egyptians&mdash;people having no better authority for this
belief, than their own unsupported opinion.</p>
<p>Thus, then, stands the argument, as well with respect to the
derivation of the Gipseys in general, as in regard to the
Egyptian descent of them in particular.&nbsp; <a
name="page3_169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>While
many men, and among these some very respectable for their
learning, declare the origin of these people to remain an
unsolved riddle, the opinion that they were not originally from
Egypt, will, it is thought, by the contents of this and the
foregoing chapter, be thoroughly confirmed.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
the innumerable researches, the Gipseys still remain
unacknowledged inmates in Europe.</p>
<p>It may nevertheless be doubted whether Swinburne is quite
right, in asserting it to be impossible ever to find out the real
home of these strangers.&nbsp; After so many unsuccessful
endeavours, it is not without apprehension, though with the
best-founded hope, we venture on another trial.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>CHAPTER V.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The Gipseys come from Hindostan</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is justly asserted, that one of
the most infallible methods of determining the origin of these
people with certainty, would be the discovery of a country where
their language was in common use.&nbsp; The first and most
necessary examination here, therefore, will be, to find out the
part of the globe in which the Gipseys&rsquo; language is that of
the natives: and this country is no other than Hindostan.&nbsp;
But before we endeavour to prove this assertion, by a comparison
of the Hindostan and Gipsey languages, it will be proper to
premise something, which will serve as an introduction of
considerable weight.&nbsp; It is an article of intelligence, to
be found in the Vienna Gazette, and comes from a Captain Szekely
von Doba, a man who was thinking of nothing less than of
searching for the Gipseys and their language in the East
Indies.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the year 1763, on the 6th of
November,&rdquo; says Captain Szekely, &ldquo;a printer, whose
name was Stephen Pap Szathmar Nemethi, came to see me.&nbsp;
Talking upon various subjects, we at last fell upon that of the
Gipseys; and my guest related to me the following anecdote, from
the mouth of a preacher of the reformed church, <a
name="page3_171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Stephen
Vali, at Almasch in the county of Komora.&mdash;When the said
Vali studied at the university of Leyden, he was intimately
acquainted with some young Malabars, of whom three are obliged
constantly to study there, nor can they return home till relieved
by three others.&nbsp; Having observed that their native language
bore a great affinity to that spoken by the Gipseys, he availed
himself of the opportunity to note down, from themselves, upwards
of one thousand words, together with their significations.&nbsp;
They assured him, at the same time, that upon their island was a
tract of land, or province, called Czigania (but it is not laid
down on the map).&nbsp; After Vali was returned from the
university, he informed himself, among the Raber Gipseys,
concerning the meaning of his Malabar words, which they explained
without trouble or hesitation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this anecdote, every thing seems to happen by chance; even
to the learned man who published it in the Gazette, it appeared
as if fallen from the clouds, and entirely oversets his system;
for he was the person, mentioned above, who broached the opinion
of the Gipseys being Mongol Tartars.&nbsp; So much more weighty,
therefore, and unexceptionable, are the hints it throws out, for
the discovery of the Gipseys&rsquo; mother country, by means of
their language.</p>
<p><a name="page3_172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>The
consideration that, according to this anecdote, the Gipsey
language is declared to be Malabar, and we have pronounced it
Hindostan, does not create any difficulty, although they are very
different from each other.&nbsp; Probably the three young men,
from whom Vali took down his words, were Bramins&rsquo; sons,
whose language was that proper to the learned Bramins, or the
Shanscritt.&nbsp; But the affinity between this and the common
language spoken by the people of Hindostan, is the same as
between pure Latin and modern Italian.&nbsp; It was therefore
very natural that the Raber Gipseys should understand, if not
all, at least the greatest part of the words which Vali repeated
to them.</p>
<p>However, we do not want this come-off.&nbsp; The difficulty
will subside without it, when we examine the connection between
the Gipsey and Hindostan languages.&nbsp; The next thing,
therefore, is to give a list of words from both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> I.&nbsp; Those syllables
which, in the oblique cases, are printed in Italics, are the
article.&nbsp; In the Gipsey, as well as in the Hindustan
language, the article is not placed before the noun, but affixed
behind it, and that is the sole indication of the case of a
noun.&nbsp; In the Gipsey tongue, the article of the nominative
case is <i>o</i> or <i>i</i>; in the Hindostan, <i>a</i> or
<i>i</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Remark</span> II.&nbsp; The Gipsey
language, as well as the Hindostan, has only two genders, the
masculine and feminine.&nbsp; Those nouns which end in i, are, in
both languages, feminine, and all the rest masculine.&nbsp; Both
languages change the masculine into the feminine gender, by
putting a <i>j</i> or an <i>i</i> for the termination.&nbsp; For

<p>The comparison thus far will, it is presumed, be sufficient to
convince every person of the truth <a name="page3_190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>of the position, that the Gipsey
language is really that of Hindostan.&nbsp; Let the reader look
over the catalogue once more, and it will appear, on the average,
that every third Gipsey word is likewise an Hindostan one; or
still more, out of thirty Gipsey words, eleven or twelve are
constantly of Hindostan.&nbsp; This agreement is uncommonly
great: it must at the same time be remembered, that the words
above communicated have been learned from the Gipseys within a
few years; consequently, at a time when they had been nearly four
complete centuries away from Hindostan, their native country (as
we may now assert it to be), among people who spoke languages
totally different, and in which the Gipseys themselves
conversed.&nbsp; Under the constant, and so long continued,
influx of these languages, their own must necessarily have
suffered great alteration; more especially as they are a people
entirely ignorant, without either writing or literature.&nbsp;
One foreign word after another must have crept into their
language; consequently, by the frequent use of such words, the
Gipsey word of the same signification was more rarely used, and
by degrees lost from their recollection: by which circumstance
the original composition of their language became completely
deranged; <a name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190"
class="citation">[190]</a> which is the reason why, as any person
may convince <a name="page3_191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>himself by inspection, various languages and
idioms&mdash;Turkish, Grecian, Latin, Wallachian, Hungarian,
Sclavonian, German, and others&mdash;make part of the foregoing
vocabulary.&nbsp; The word <i>rome</i>, <i>man</i>, is Coptic;
with, perhaps, a few more.&nbsp; It does not appear that there is
so much Persian in the Gipsey language, as has been generally
imagined; and even what there is of it they may have brought with
them from their native country, as many Persian words are current
in Hindostan.</p>
<p>After all these reflections, we ought rather to wonder that
the number of Hindostan words in the Gipsey language is so
considerable, than to require it should be greater, in order to
furnish sufficient proof of the Hindostan language being the
Gipseys&rsquo; mother tongue.</p>
<p>But we have a right, from the agreement which appears in the
catalogue published, to conclude the affinity is much more
intimate.&nbsp; The idea hitherto adopted has been that, among
the Gipsey words quoted, all those of the Hindostan language,
answering to the annexed meaning, appear, which are still extant
in the Gipsey language.&nbsp; But this is certainly by no means
the case.&nbsp; It will be recollected, from the first part, how
great a secret the Gipseys make of their language, and how
suspicious they appear when any person wishes to learn a few
words of it.&nbsp; Even if the Gipsey is not perverse, he is very
<a name="page3_192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>inattentive; and is consequently likely to answer some
other rather than the true Gipsey word.&nbsp; Under such
circumstances, it is very possible, nay even probable, that in
the foregoing catalogue there may many words be inserted, for
which true Gipsey, of course Hindostan, words might be found; but
that the Gipseys when enquired of, either from levity or by
design, did not declare them.</p>
<p>Further, it is not all absurd to pronounce, that there remain
more, or at least different, true Gipsey words among those
residing in one country than another.&nbsp; And if, at a future
period, some person should, as an experiment on the above
catalogue, examine a second or third time parties of Gipseys in
different countries, and compare the words obtained with those
already delivered, the catalogue would certainly receive a
considerable augmentation in favour of our hypothesis.</p>
<p>Finally, we must consider the Hindostan language itself.&nbsp;
This, it is true, is fundamentally the same all over Hindostan;
but, like every other language in the world, has different
dialects in the various provinces.&nbsp; The eastern dialect,
spoken about the Ganges, has different names for some things, and
different inflexions of some words, from the western one spoken
about the Indus.&nbsp; There is, besides, a third, varying from
both these, viz. the Surat dialect, which has a number of <a
name="page3_193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Malabar
and other words mixed with it.&nbsp; To this must be added, that
in the Hindostan, as well as in every other language, there are
often several names for the same thing.&nbsp; The particular
dialect bearing the closest affinity to the Gipsey language, as
will appear hereafter, is the western, and perhaps more
especially that of Surat.&nbsp; Had this therefore, or the
western one in general, been the standard of the above
comparison; and had we not, for want of words in these dialects,
been obliged frequently to have recourse to the eastern one,
spoken in Bengal; or had we, even in the latter, been able to
obtain so many words, that where the Gipsey, from not knowing any
more, could only give us a single expression, we might have
produced, not one or two as at present, but all, or at least the
greater part, of the synonymous appellations: we should
infallibly in this manner recover, in the Hindostan language,
many a Gipsey word, which even the learned are unable to derive
from the European or any other language, and yet have as little
appearance of being Hindostan.&nbsp; With respect to the
construction and inflexions of the two languages, they are
evidently the same.&nbsp; That of Hindostan has only two genders;
the Gipsey the same.&nbsp; In the former every word ended in
<i>j</i> is feminine, all the rest masculine; in the latter the
same rule is observed.&nbsp; That makes the inflections entirely
by the article, <a name="page3_194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>adding it at the end of the word; the Gipsey language
proceeds exactly in the same manner.&nbsp; Finally, likewise,
bating a trifling variation, this identical similarity is evident
in the pronouns.</p>
<p>So much for the language of the Gipseys.&nbsp; As this is
indubitably Hindostan, it would be sufficient of itself to prove
the descent of those people from Hindostan.&nbsp; But we shall
now proceed to other grounds, which, united with the proofs from
the language, will leave us less reason to doubt concerning this
matter.</p>
<p>That the Gipseys, and natives of Hindostan, resemble each
other in complexion and shape, and are equally timorous and
cowardly, is undeniable.&nbsp; But we shall pass over these,
together with some other circumstances; as, perhaps, neither the
one nor the other are such distinguishing marks as not to be met
with among other Oriental people.</p>
<p>The name of Polgar, likewise, carries some weight with it,
which we find among the Gipseys in the earliest times, before
they began to change the names they brought with them for those
used in Europe.&nbsp; Polgar, as we may remember, was the name of
the leader who, in the year 1496, obtained a safe-conduct from
the Hungarian king Uladislaus II. by virtue of which he, with his
horde, consisting of twenty-five tents or families, had the
liberty of travelling about where he pleased.&nbsp; <a
name="page3_195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>This name
Polgar originates in India, where it is the appellation of a
deity presiding over marriages and matrimonial concerns: the
Indians are very fond of bearing this name, as well as the names
of their other deities.</p>
<p>In reciting the employments of the Gipseys, their
smith&rsquo;s business was mentioned; when it was remarked, that
their anvil is a stone, and what more implements they use consist
in a pair of hand-bellows, a pair of tongs, a hammer, a vise, and
a file.&nbsp; With such a portable apparatus, the travelling
Gipsey wanders from place to place.&nbsp; We will compare this
account with what Sonnerat relates of the Indian smiths: the
following are his own words: &ldquo;The smith carries his tools,
his shop, and his forge, about with him, and works in any place
where he can find employment: he erects his shop before the house
of his employer, raising a low wall with beaten earth, before
which he places his hearth; behind this wall he fixes two
leathern bellows, which his apprentice blows alternately, to keep
up the fire.&nbsp; He has a stone instead of an anvil, and his
whole apparatus is a pair of tongs, a hammer, a beetle, and a
file.&rdquo;&nbsp; The most striking circumstance relating to
this coincidence is, that both Gipsey and Indian should use the
same kind of hand-bellows, and both have exactly two.&nbsp; As
the <a name="page3_196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>apprentice works these for the Indian, so does the wife
or one of the children for the Gipsey.</p>
<p>What is asserted of the young Gipsey girls, rambling about
with their fathers who are musicians, dancing with all kinds of
indecent and lascivious attitudes and gestures, to divert any
person who is willing to give them a small gratuity for so
acting, is likewise perfectly Indian.&nbsp; Sonnerat confirms
this also.&mdash;&ldquo;Surat is,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;famous
for its dancing girls.&nbsp; These young women devote themselves
entirely to the worship of the Gods, whom they attend in the
processions, dancing and singing before the representations of
them.&nbsp; The handycraftsmen generally destine the youngest of
their daughters to this service, and send them to the pagoda
before they come to the age of puberty.&nbsp; There they have
dancing and music masters, with persons to teach them to
sing.&nbsp; The Bramins form their young minds, and deflower
them; in the end, they become common prostitutes.&nbsp; They then
join in companies, take musicians with them, to entertain
any-body who chooses to engage them, with music and
dancing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sonnerat speaks here likewise of the wanton
gestures of these dancing girls, of which he has given a drawing;
and ends his description thus: &ldquo;The blinking of their
eyes&mdash;half open, half shut&mdash;and the negligent sinking
<a name="page3_197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>of
their bodies, to the most languishing music, shew that their
whole frame breathes nothing but lasciviousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortune-telling is practised all over the east; but the
peculiar kind professed by the Gipseys, viz.
<i>chiromancy</i>&mdash;constantly referring to whether the
parties shall be rich or poor, fortunate or unhappy in marriage;
whether they shall have many or few children, &amp;c.&mdash;is
no-where met with but in India.&nbsp; The following instance will
evince, how perfectly Gipseyish it is: &ldquo;It once
happened,&rdquo; says Bald&aelig;us, &ldquo;that the Rajah Khans
made his appearance before the inhabitants; when being given to
understand that an experienced Bramin was arrived, he ordered him
to be brought before him, and said&mdash;&lsquo;Narret (that was
his name), look at my daughter&rsquo;s hand, and inform me
whether she will be happy or unfortunate, poor or rich; whether
she will have many or few children; if her life will be long or
short: speak out freely, and conceal nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Bramin having looked at her hand, replied, &lsquo;May it please
your Majesty, according to the indication of these lines, I read
thus&mdash;She shall bear seven children, viz. six sons and a
daughter; the youngest of whom shall not only deprive you of your
crown and empire, but likewise of your head and life, and
afterwards place himself in <a name="page3_198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>your seat.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This
method, Bald&aelig;us adds, of looking in the hands, is very
common among the heathens.</p>
<p>The excessive loquacity of the Gipseys, as well as their very
advantageous natural qualities, which have been before noticed,
are likewise distinguishing characteristics of the Indian;
besides, the very name Zigeuner, or, according to a broader way
of pronunciation, Ciganen and Tchingenen, is the appellation of
an Indian people, living at the mouth of the Indus, as mentioned
by Thevenot.</p>
<p>Another striking intimation of the Indian descent of the
Gipseys, is the partiality of the latter for red colours, or
saffron: in like manner the Bramin performs all his religious
duties in a white dress, without the least mixture of any other
colour.&nbsp; On his return home from these functions, he changes
his white turban for a red one.&nbsp; The common Indians also
prefer this colour for their little round caps: and these last,
especially on holidays, make a double deep yellow stripe on their
foreheads with fat, saffron, and sacred cow-dung.&nbsp; The
Bramins make the same stripe with <i>red</i>, as a mark of
pre-eminence.&nbsp; Again, the Gipseys as Twiss assures us of
those in Spain, never intermarry with any people who are not,
like themselves, of Gipsey extraction; which puts us strongly in
mind of the Indian castes.</p>
<h3><a name="page3_199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The Gipseys are of the Caste called
Suders</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> come now to the position we
hoped to substantiate, viz. that the Gipseys are of the lowest
class of Indians, namely, <i>Parias</i>; or, as they are called
in Hindostan, <i>Suders</i>.</p>
<p>The whole great nation of Indians is known to be divided into
four ranks or stocks, which are called by a Portuguese name,
castes, each of which has its own particular subdivisions.&nbsp;
Of these castes, the <i>Bramin</i> is the first: the second
contains the <i>Tschechteries</i> or <i>Setreas</i>: the third
consists of the <i>Beis</i> or <i>Wasziers</i>: the fourth is the
caste of the just-mentioned <i>Suders</i>; who upon the Peninsula
of Malabar, where their condition is the same as in Hindostan,
are called <i>Parias</i> or <i>Parier</i>.</p>
<p>The relative situation of these four castes, and the grounds
of their difference, rest on the Indian fable of the
Creation.&nbsp; This relates, that the God who created Bruma,
ordained that the Bramin should proceed out of Bruma&rsquo;s
mouth; the Tschechterie out of his arms; the Beis out of his
legs; and the Suder from his feet.&nbsp; As Bruma afterwards
allotted the employments of each of these stocks, <a
name="page3_200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>he
appointed the first to seek after knowledge, to give instruction,
and to take care of religion; the second was to serve in war; the
third was, as well as the Bramin, to cultivate science, but to
attend particularly to the breeding of cattle and agriculture:
the caste of Suders was destined to be subservient to the
Bramins, the Tschechteries, and the Beis.&nbsp; These Suders are
held in the greatest contempt: they are considered infamous and
unclean, from their occupations; and they are abhorred because
they eat flesh, the three other castes living entirely on
vegetables.</p>
<p>Of this very caste, as will appear by the following
comparison, our Gipseys are composed.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Gipseys are in the highest degree
filthy, and disgusting; and with regard to character, of the most
depraved hearts: that they are thievish, liars, and fraudulent to
excess:&mdash;and these are exactly the qualities of the
Suders.&nbsp; Bald&aelig;us says, &ldquo;The Pareas are a filthy
race, in a word, a contemptible stinking people; a wicked crew,
who in winter steal much cattle, kill them, and sell the
hides.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is again related in the Danish Mission
Intelligence, &ldquo;Nobody can deny that the Bareier are the
dregs and refuse of all the Indians: they have wicked
dispositions, are thievish, arrant liars, are intractable with
good usage, require to be kept in order by fear and blows, and
held under continual restraint.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page3_201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>Moreover,
Neuhof assures us, &ldquo;The Parruas are full of every kind of
dishonesty; they do not consider lying and cheating to be sinful,
as they have no other maxim or custom among them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Gipsey&rsquo;s solicitude to conceal his language, is
likewise a striking Indian trait.&nbsp; &ldquo;Custom,&rdquo;
says Pallas, of the Indians round Astrakan, &ldquo;has rendered
them to the greatest degree suspicious about their language,
insomuch that I never was able to obtain a small vocabulary from
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the foregoing, the Gipseys love to intoxicate
themselves; they are particularly fond of brandy, because it more
speedily answers their purpose than any other liquor.&nbsp; Among
the Suders we find this inclination is universal; though other
Indians do not commit such excess, or very seldom, and then
privately.</p>
<p>What has been further said with respect to the immoral life of
the Gipseys, agrees perfectly with the Suders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their
wives and daughters,&rdquo; says Neuhof, &ldquo;make no
difficulty of yielding up their persons, for money, to any sort
of people, be they of what country or religion soever; as the
inclination of this tribe tends more to voluptuousness, than
towards diligence or industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to Gipsey marriages, it has been asserted, that it
is a matter of indifference to them whether the party be the
nearest relation or an <a name="page3_202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>utter stranger, or, as Salmon
expresses himself, the nearest relations cohabit like beasts with
each other; and as to education, that their children grow up in
the most shameful neglect, without either discipline or
instruction.&nbsp; All this is precisely the case with the
Pariars.&nbsp; In the Journals of the Missionaries already
quoted, it is said, &ldquo;With respect to matrimony, they act
like the beasts; and their children are brought up without
restraint or information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gipseys are fond of being about horses; so are the Suders in
India, for which reason they are commonly employed as
horsekeepers by the Europeans resident in that country.</p>
<p>The Gipseys were formerly employed as flayers, hangmen, and
executioners, all over Hungary and Transylvania; and they still
readily perform those offices whenever called upon.&nbsp; In like
manner, in India, no one who is not of the caste of Suders will
on any account transact that kind of business.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Gipseys hunt after cattle which have
died of distempers, in order to feed on them; and where they can
provide more of the flesh than is sufficient for one day&rsquo;s
consumption, dry it in the sun: such is likewise a constant
custom with the Pariars in India.&nbsp; It &ldquo;is their
office,&rdquo; according to the accounts we have of them,
&ldquo;to remove carrion, which they cut up; part they boil fresh
and eat, other parts <a name="page3_203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>they dry in pieces, by the heat of
the sun, for their future provision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hitherto the accounts of the Gipseys and Suders perfectly
coincide.&nbsp; Even the before-mentioned smiths and dancing
girls are of this caste: and as they before shewed, in general,
from the similarity of their make, that they were of Indian
extraction, so in this instance they give particular evidence,
that they are descendants from the lowest class.</p>
<p>But there are still some further traits relating to the
Gipseys; we shall now examine whether they also are to be found
among the Suders.&nbsp; Of these the first is, that the Gipseys
always choose their place of residence near some village or city;
very seldom within the village or city, even though there may be
no order to prevent it: as is the case in Moldavia, Wallachia,
and all parts of Turkey.&nbsp; Even the more improved Gipseys, as
those in Transylvania, who have long since discontinued their
wandering mode of life, and might, with permission from
government, reside within the cities, yet rather choose to build
their huts in some bye-place, without their limits.&nbsp; This
custom seems to be a remnant of their original Suder education;
it being usual, all over India, for the Suders to have their huts
without the villages of the other castes, and in retired places
near their cities.</p>
<p>Further, with regard to the Gipseys&rsquo; religion, <a
name="page3_204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>we may
recollect, from what has been said, that their sense of it is
very confined, and that they have not the least degree of
steadiness in it.&nbsp; To the Gipseys, every persuasion is the
same; as often as he meets with a different one, he changes his
opinions.&nbsp; To-day he receives the sacrament as a Lutheran;
next Sunday, from a Roman-catholic; and perhaps before the end of
the week partakes of the communion in a Reformed church.&nbsp;
Yet the greater part of them do not even go so far as this, but
live without any religion at all, and are, as Tollius says, worse
than heathens.&nbsp; The more wonderful such an appearance
is&mdash;of a whole people being so void of and indifferent about
religion&mdash;the more weight it carries with it to confirm
their Indian origin, when all this is found to be literally true
of the Suders.&nbsp; &ldquo;This race,&rdquo; says Rogerius, of
the Suders in the kingdom of Surat, &ldquo;seems to be neither
heathens nor Mahometans; they live on in their own way, without
any religion, or worshipping of God.&nbsp; There are some, it is
true, who imitate the other castes in an outward shew of
religion, and appoint priests for themselves; but they neither
frequent the pagodas of the higher castes, nor have any of their
own: and as to the choice of their deities, every one conforms to
the custom of the place where he lives, or happens to remain a
short time, exactly the same as the Gipseys.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page3_205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>If
people, in reflecting on the emigration of the Gipseys, are not
determined to imagine that they were actuated by a blind impulse,
to break up at once, and quit their native country; no cause can
be assigned for their retreat from thence so plausible as the war
of Timur Beg in India.&nbsp; The date of their arrival marks it
very plainly.&nbsp; It was in the years 1408 and 1409 that this
conqueror ravaged India; and having persuaded himself, as well as
his followers, that he had undertaken the expedition against
India for the purpose of disseminating the Mahometan religion,
his war was oppressive enough to occasion such an
emigration.&nbsp; Not only every one who made any resistance was
destroyed, and such as fell into the enemy&rsquo;s hands, though
quite defenceless, were made slaves, but in a short time these
very slaves, to the number of a hundred thousand, were put to
death.&nbsp; As in consequence an universal panic took place,
nobody being secure that it might not be his own fate in a short
time, what could be more natural than that a great number of
terrified inhabitants should endeavour to save themselves by
flight?</p>
<p>An objection naturally occurs, that when this supposed flight
took place, had it been true, not Gipseys only, or the lowest
class of people, but with them all sorts of Indians, of superior
rank, would have come among us.&nbsp; But this argument will fall
of itself, when we reflect on the prepossession <a
name="page3_206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>which the
three higher castes of Indians entertain for their country.&nbsp;
They ascribe an extraordinary degree of holiness to it, and
believe it to be the only country thought, by the Creator of the
universe, worthy for such sanctified people as the Bramins,
Tschechteries, and Beis, to dwell in.&nbsp; They would rather
suffer torture and death, than quit this land, chosen by the
Almighty himself for their residence, to go and dwell any-where
else.&nbsp; Moreover a Suder is, in their estimation, the most
execrable being in the world; and the least intercourse with him
would be defiling and degrading their high characters, which, to
them, would be more dreadful than death.&nbsp; Wherefore it was a
moral impossibility for those of a higher caste to have any thing
in common with a Suder, or that they should have made an united
retreat.&nbsp; Finally, by putting themselves into the power of
the Suders, with whom they live constantly in a state of discord
and inveteracy, they would have hazarded a greater danger, than
by patiently risking their fate from the hands of their common
enemy.&nbsp; If any of the higher ranks of Indians did withdraw
themselves, on account of the troubles, it is probable they
retired southwards, to people of their own sort, the
Mahrattas.</p>
<p>As every part to the northward and eastward was beset by the
enemy, and no passage left in those directions for escaping, it
seems most probable <a name="page3_207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>that the countries below Multan, to
the mouth of the Indus, were the first asylum and rendezvous of
the fugitive Suders.&nbsp; Here they were safe; and so remained,
till Timur returned from his victories on the Ganges.&nbsp; Then
it was that they first entirely quitted the country; and,
probably, with them a considerable number of the proper
inhabitants about the Indus, which will explain the meaning of
their original name, Ciganen, or, according to the German mode of
speaking, Zigeuner.&nbsp; For if it was in the country of the
Zinganen that these terrified fugitives collected; and they
afterwards drew a considerable number of the Zinganen themselves
along with them, nothing could be more easy or natural than that
the people who had assembled from the general wreck should take
the name of the greater number.</p>
<p>By what route they came to us, cannot be ascertained: if they
went straight through the southern Persian deserts of Sigistan,
Makran, and Kirman, along the Persian Gulph to the mouth of the
Euphrates, thence they might get, by Bassora, into the great
deserts of Arabia, afterwards into Arabia Petr&aelig;a, and so
arrive in Egypt, by the isthmus of Suez.&nbsp; They must
certainly have been in Egypt before they reached us; otherwise we
cannot account for the report that they were Egyptians.&nbsp; In
what manner they <a name="page3_208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>were afterwards transported to Europe is also an
obscure research: perhaps it was effected by means of the Turks,
who, being at that time fully employed with the Grecian empire,
might permit the Gipseys to travel about with the rabble of
Serdenjesti and Nephers, who were appointed to go on ravaging
parties.&nbsp; However, all that can be said upon that subject is
mere surmise.&nbsp; The chief aim in this Dissertation was, to
prove that the Gipseys came from Hindostan, and that they were
Suders, which it is hoped has been accomplished.&nbsp; When every
thing, even the most fortuitous concomitant circumstances, but
particularly that most decisive one&mdash;the similarity of their
language to that of Hindostan, uniformly point out that
extraction, we cannot believe them to belong to a different
country, and to be descended from another people.</p>
<h2><a name="page3_209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>SUPPLEMENT.</h2>
<p>To invalidate, if possible, the charge of
cannibalism&mdash;apparently so well founded&mdash;brought
against the Gipsey tribe, it is thought proper in this place to
mention circumstances, relative to the proceedings in Hungary,
which at least render the justice of the sentence pronounced
against these devoted people doubtful.</p>
<p>In the year 1534, as recorded in the Hungarian history, the
Gipseys were suspected of traitorously assisting John Zapolya; in
consequence of which the governor of Leutschau, <i>Tsernabo</i>,
sent some horsemen to arrest a company of them, near Iglo: the
greatest part escaped by flight; only a few old men and boys were
taken, who were brought into Leutschau.&nbsp; These confessed
circumstantially (which certainly appears improbable, that men
should lye to effect their own ruin), as well before, as upon the
rack, the following falsities&mdash;That a hundred of them had
been sent by Zapolya since the middle of Lent, and had agreed for
a sum of money to set fire to the five chief cities, Kaschau,
Leutschau, Bartfeld, Eperies, and Zeben: that the preceding
Saturday several of them had privately entered Leutschau,
disguised like Wallachians and shepherds, under the pretence of
selling skins: that they laid fire in various places; and
moreover, that they had murdered several people: and finally,
that they had letters from Zapolya to thirteen different cities,
with orders to afford them shelter and protection within their
districts, as long as they chose to remain.&nbsp; In consequence
of this confession they were impaled, &ldquo;but whether justly
or not,&rdquo; adds the Chronicle, &ldquo;that, let him answer
for who condemned them:&rdquo; for on being conducted about the
town, to shew in what places they had laid the fire, they could
not specify them; besides, they denied every thing when they came
to execution.</p>
<p>Except the circumstance of retracting, of which nothing is
mentioned in the sentence of death, the above case seems to be
exactly similar to that of the men-eaters executed in Hungary in
1782.&nbsp; These were taken upon suspicion of theft; in the
course of their examination something escaped them which gave
occasion to think <a name="page3_210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>they had committed murder, and the
criminals being interrogated on this point, perhaps on account of
the severity used, or probably from an idea of heroism (a very
common trait in their character), they confessed the fact, and
chattered away till they had filled the paper, without
considering consequences.&nbsp; When desired to state where they
had deposited the bodies, they promised to shew, but on being
brought to the spot nothing was found, and they endeavoured to
run off.&nbsp; Nevertheless, having once confessed, they were put
on the rack.&nbsp; As the persons said to have been murdered
could not be found, the judge imagined they must have eaten them,
which, though denied by the poor miserable wretches, decided
their fate.</p>
<h3>(A)</h3>
<p>How much the Gipsey language has altered by time, may be seen,
in a striking manner, from the following translations of the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, obtained from Hungarian Gipseys at different
periods.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1.&nbsp; Lord&rsquo;s Prayer,
according to the old translation.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">2.&nbsp; The same, according to a
more modern translation.</p>
<p>Muro Dad, kolim andro therosz; Ta weltro szentanao; Ta weltro

there was a dreadful execution at Frauenmark in the Hortenser
country.&nbsp; Thirteen delinquents, Gipseys, who had existed
twelve years by robbing on the highway, and were accustomed to
eat the bodies of those they had murdered, were brought to
punishment.&nbsp; Four of them were women, who were beheaded; of
the remaining nine men, six were hanged, two were broken on the

4th of September.&mdash;The following is to be added concerning
the murderers and man-eaters.&nbsp; Forty of these miscreants
have already undergone their deserved punishment, in three
separate places.&nbsp; Some, as lately communicated, were broken
upon the wheel from below upwards; two of the most atrocious were
quartered alive; and the remainder, one hundred and fifteen in
number, will shortly be proceeded against in the same
manner.&nbsp; This band has existed twenty-one years, and in the
course of that time sacrificed eighty-four people to their
cruelty.&nbsp; Every feeling mind must be struck with horror at
the infernal rage of these European cannibals, on hearing their
confession&mdash;that once at a wedding they killed three people,
whom they ate with their guests, in the greatest festivity and
joy!&nbsp; They prefer the flesh of a young person from sixteen
to eighteen years old.&nbsp; They burnt the bones, which,
according to their account, make excellent coals.&nbsp; A
life-guard man of the country undertook to secure and succeeded
in taking their <i>harumpascha</i> or leader.&nbsp; This cannibal
hero was magnificently dressed, and wore ornaments in his cap to
the value of six thousand guilders.&rdquo;</p>

Theresa had given orders that all these human vermin should be

at Esabrag.&nbsp; In the former place were seven women beheaded,
five men hanged, two broken alive on the wheel, and one quartered
alive.&nbsp; At the latter place seven women were beheaded, four
men hanged and two broken on the wheel.&nbsp; Many still remain
in confinement; among whom is one who acted as priest, and
married people for two groschens a time.&nbsp; Their

very simple stratagem, cannot yet be brought to any confession of

been executed in Hungary.&nbsp; One hundred and fifty still
remain in prison, whose sentence has, by express orders from
court, been respited.&nbsp; Her majesty, not thinking it possible
that the people in confinement could have been guilty of such
enormous crimes, sent a commissary thither from court to examine
minutely into the affair.&nbsp; On his return it was confirmed

the first quality in Petersburgh used to be guilty of somewhat
the same kind of irregularity.&nbsp; They had begun to adopt the
French modes in dress; but, as Salmon says, did not well know how
to manage them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore,&rdquo; he continues,
&ldquo;one must not be surprised, notwithstanding all the state
of a Petersburgh lady, to meet one of them in summer, at which
season they use the English straw hats, magnificently dressed in

esteem among the Transalpine Wallachians, who have consigned over
these two amiable sisters to the licentiousness of
slaves&mdash;Gipseys.&nbsp; These alone sing, play,
rhyme&mdash;for we cannot allow the appellation of poems to
obscene hobbling verses, put together at the moment.&nbsp; By way
of sample take the following couplet:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ba nu</i>, <i>Ba nu</i>, <i>n&rsquo; am tsche
f&aacute;tsch</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <i>tsche f&aacute;tsch</i>, which should be <i>tsche se
fak</i>, is a monstrous perversion of language.&nbsp; But the
Gipsey wanted a rhyme for <i>quatsch</i>; so directly, with a
bold poetical licence, he changes the first person of the
conjunctive for the third of the indicative mood.&nbsp; Thus this
little composition, in question and answer, which should be,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little one, Little one, come
from thence!<br />
No, no, no, no, <i>I have nothing to do</i> (<i>there</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he changes to, <i>I have nothing</i>, <i>what do you</i>?</p>

timidity, says: &ldquo;A Gipsey requires to have been a long time
in the army before he can meet an enemy&rsquo;s balls with decent
soldier&rsquo;s resolution; or to be an experienced robber,
before he can take a traveller&rsquo;s purse, without having
first, from a bush, either killed or disabled him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is a proverb in Transylvania, that &ldquo;You may drive
fifty Gipseys before you with a wet rag.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thicknesse

people experience greater oppression and misery than what were
suffered by the Jews of that time.&nbsp; All the gaols and
prisons were crowded with them; they were put to the rack in
every judicial court.&nbsp; The day was scarcely long enough for
the execution of the poor condemned wretches; nor were the nights
ever dark, by reason of the continual fires which were kept
burning every-where, to consume them at the stake.&nbsp; Vast
numbers, who had escaped the rigour of the tribunals, fell a
sacrifice to popular fury.&nbsp; They were suffocated in bogs,
slaughtered like flies, and destroyed by other summary
means.&nbsp; There was no distinction made of age or sex: the
same unrelenting fate pursued men and women, children and
grey-headed, without exception.&nbsp; To all this was added the
plague, which attacked the Jews as well as the Christians.&nbsp;
Under such circumstances, it is no wonder if such as could escape
from a persecution so dreadful, and unmerited, really did secret
themselves in the most retired corners.</p>

class="footnote">[154]</a>&nbsp; Sultan Selim had drawn out his
troops against Persia, with the determination, if not to conquer
the country entirely, at least to do them all the mischief he
could; for which reason his tremendous army was already, in 1517,
encamped near Aleppo.&nbsp; G&auml;wri, the Circassian Sultan in
Egypt, when he heard of this enterprise, being fearful that after
Selim had accomplished his intentions respecting Persia, he might
attack him, sent ambassadors, to offer his assistance against the
Persians.&nbsp; Selim accepted it, and G&auml;wri immediately
collected his forces.&nbsp; As the two armies lay near each
other, it so happened that some Circassians attacked, and
plundered, some loaded camels, which were going to Selim&rsquo;s
camp.&nbsp; Selim, who looked upon this as an affront, instantly
resolved to leave the Persians quiet for the present, and to draw
his sword against his ally.&nbsp; This he accordingly did, and
G&auml;wri, being betrayed by two of his generals, was defeated,
and fell in the action.&nbsp; Those who escaped from the battle
fled to Kahire, where they related what had passed; and a general
assembly being convened, they immediately proceeded to the
election of a new king, Tumanbey.&nbsp; He marched to attack
Selim once more, was defeated, and having experienced various
reverses of fortune, at last fell into his hands.&nbsp; Selim was
so charmed with his understanding, that he not only granted him
his freedom, but intended to appoint him viceroy over
Egypt.&nbsp; However, before this event took place, people began
to talk freely concerning their hopes, that when Selim should
have withdrawn, Tumanbey, with the remaining Circassians and
Arabians, might be able to drive his troops out of Egypt, and
reinstate the Circassians in their former dominion.&nbsp; These
reports came to Selim&rsquo;s knowledge; yet his confidence was
so great, that he at first did not entertain any suspicion of
Tumanbey.&nbsp; But at length, when they continued, and even
increased, he ordered the unhappy man to be arrested, and hanged
under one of the gates of Kahire.&nbsp; On which occasion, like a
true barbarian, he made use of the following words: &ldquo;How
great my favour was towards him, I have sufficiently proved; the
effects of his partisans&rsquo; conversation, let the wretch
himself experience.&rdquo;&nbsp; With him not only ended the
government of the Circassians in Egypt, after it had continued
286 years, but, by command of Selim, they were for several days
left to the mercy of their conquerors, who treated them with the
greatest cruelty.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
